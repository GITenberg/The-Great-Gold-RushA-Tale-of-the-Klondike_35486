<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>There is a freemasonry among Klondikers which rules that no tales shall
be told out of school. If, therefore, this were an historical novel, if
I were telling tales and seeking to escape censure by the subterfuge of
changing names, I could hardly succeed. Let me take the case of Poo-Bah,
for instance. The reader with a knowledge of the early days of Dawson
accepting the story as historical, would fix as the original any one of
half a dozen men indecently caricatured. But if he is told the character
is a composite one, that it is the personification of Dawson graft, or,
in other words, that it is the sum of a merger, he will understand and,
I think, make no complaint.</p>

<p>Otherwise the story may be accepted as the author's best effort to
convey a true account of the different phases of the world's most
remarkable stampede. The stories of corruption among the officials in
Dawson are those which a visitor would have heard on every hand, and at
the present time there are many old-timers in the Yukon who will tell
tales similar to the incidents I have introduced in my story.<span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>When one of my characters speaks of the Dawson officials as petty
larceny thieves and highway robbers, it is to be understood to be a
sample of the phraseology in vogue at the time.</p>

<p>The different types of prospector I have attempted to portray are those
I have met, lived with, and mixed with. Should it appear I have given
too much space to the humble economies of the miner's life, I shall
advance as my excuse the lack of our literature in this particular.</p>

<p>I have also made a humble attempt to establish the respectability of the
miner. So much has been written to compromise him, and so many
imaginations have drawn lurid pictures of his morals, I feel it his due.</p>

<p>In a general way the reader may accept anything in my story which has
none other than an historical interest as being accurate.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Rev. Archdeacon Macdonald, now of Winnipeg, for the
story of his first discovery of gold. For the story of the discovery of
Franklin Gulch I am indebted to Mr. William Hartz, who also furnished
the accounts of the finding of gold in the Stewart River. These accounts
have never before been written.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT GOLD RUSH</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE FORTUNE-SEEKERS</h3>


<p>Those who join the stampede to a new goldfield may generally be divided
into two classes, the tenderfoot and the old-timer; otherwise, the
novice and the experienced prospector.</p>

<p>The novice joins the stampede because he catches the "fever"&mdash;dreams
dreams. The old-timer goes because the diggings he had last worked in
proved of little good.</p>

<p>Were the sea-dogs of old&mdash;Drake, Raleigh, or Frobisher&mdash;born into the
world to-day, their spirit would surely have impelled them to the mining
camp, to seek fortune in the mountain fastnesses, and to wager years of
effort on the chance of wresting from Nature her treasure stores.</p>

<p>On the steamship <i>Aleutian</i>, as she lay in the dock at Vancouver,
British Columbia, one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> in the March of 1898, there were many
tenderfeet and a few old-timers. Amongst the experienced was John
Berwick. About him surged the steamship's host of passengers, waving
their arms, and yelling answers to the cheer that went up from the great
crowd upon the dock-side.</p>

<p>He and his fellows were bound for the Klondike goldfields. Before them
lay adventures, toil, and danger; the adventurous will ever draw the
tributes of goodwill from the multitude staying at home.</p>

<p>The air was chill and damp; and the increased speed of the steamer as
she passed from the harbour accentuated the effect of the breeze that
blew against her, so that Berwick felt cold. He shivered, and half
turned towards the door across the promenade; but the wavelets, flying
by in their half-blue, half-grey ripples, fascinated him, and he
lingered. Suddenly he was aroused&mdash;a hand was on his shoulder, and he
heard a familiar voice say,</p>

<p>"Hullo, old chum!"</p>

<p>John swung round. He looked into the smiling face of his old-time
mining-mate, George Bruce.</p>

<p>"George, by all the gods!" he cried. "Are you bound for the diggings,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and mighty glad to find an old mate. I told you, when you left
Coolgardie, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> wouldn't stand civilization long, but had no idea
of running across you in this rush."</p>

<p>The two turned and entered the saloon together. Neither mentioned it,
but each knew that in the adventures before them their efforts and their
fortunes would be joined. In the language of the Australian, they were
mates, or, in the vernacular of their new surroundings, "partners."</p>

<p>George Bruce was tall and athletic, with golden hair. He was a jovial
soul, blessed with a body of activity. He would go for the hardest work
in a cheery way, and during the social hours of evening was the best of
company. He was as liberal with his money and means as he was of
good-nature.</p>

<p>The saloon was crowded with men, drifting about, staring at all they
met, or talking in groups. On the lower deck dogs could be heard
barking. The ship was tense with an atmosphere of excitement.</p>

<p>Berwick and his "pardner" went by a companion-way to the lower deck,
where they found a passage-way to the fore-part of the ship, and so came
to the presence of the canine choir. Big dogs and little dogs, of every
breed and colour, were there. All grades of canine society were
represented, from the big and well-fed St. Bernard to the mongrel snared
in the slums. Dogs were a safe investment in the towns on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> the Pacific
Coast of North America, and unscrupulous humanity was actively at work
capturing them and getting them there.</p>

<p>The portion of the deck to which the dogs were relegated was also set
apart for the baggage, which was piled in heaps in the middle. A dozen
men were diving into kit-bags, extracting necessary articles or packing
them away. The inspiration of the last few minutes in Vancouver had
prompted many to purchase odds and ends which had been forgotten in the
general outfitting.</p>

<p>A tall, angular man was attending to three dogs of an uncommon breed.
Two of them were practically of the same size, which was that of an
ordinary collie; the third was not so large. All had the same markings,
black with tan about the face and neck, and a show of tan about the
legs, but the hair on the two larger was longer than on the third. This
couple also had bushy tails which curled over their backs, while the
tail of the smaller dog was only a stump. John recognized them from
their wolfish look as belonging to a Northern breed. George and he
became interested.</p>

<p>After watching the dogs for a minute, John approached one of them and
patted him, remarking to his owner, "Your dogs don't seem
over-affectionate."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"They don't make much noise."</p>

<p>"These dogs never bark."</p>

<p>"Why is that?"</p>

<p>"Don't know; suppose it is because they have wolf in them; but they howl
when the spirit moves them."</p>

<p>"Often?"</p>

<p>"Only when they are alone, and then generally at night."</p>

<p>The conversation was lapsing when the stranger turned and gazed at the
mountains showing through the mist along the coast.</p>

<p>"Those mountains look kind o' cold," said he. "You fellows going
inside?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John.</p>

<p>"Come from Australia?" The stranger had evidently been sizing them up.
"There are a whole lot going inside from Australia, I hear."</p>

<p>"The only man I know on board is George Bruce here, my mate; but there
is such a crowd about&mdash;there may be others!"</p>

<p>"The passes are already crowded&mdash;a whole lot of these fellows don't know
what they are up against." The man shook his head with an aspect of
melancholy.</p>

<p>"Been in the Klondike before?" Berwick asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes, five years ago. I came down from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> River in '96, just before
the news of Carmack's discovery reached Forty Mile, or else I would have
been in on the best of it. The fellows sent me out word right after, but
I didn't think the pay streak would hold, so didn't go in last year. But
this spring I got so dead sick of civilization I just had to get away,
although I don't think there's much chance of my striking it rich."</p>

<p>"Your dogs are Yukon dogs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Malamoots. I brought them out with me just to kind of keep me from
getting homesick, but they worked the other way. I took them back on the
home ranch, and every time they set up a howl on winter nights I began
to see the old Northern Lights sky-shooting overhead, and smell the
bean-pot boiling, and I'd feel like getting down a hole to bed-rock
somewhere and trying a pan of dirt. Besides, the folks outside, I don't
like their ways; they ask a man so many fool questions. They all want to
know why I ain't a millionaire. You see I've been up to Bonanza Creek
where Carmack made his discovery, and where the rich claims have been
discovered, a dozen times. We used to call it Rabbit Creek, and there
were always a half-dozen moose or so mooching round, and we used to go
shooting then."</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever try a dish of gravel?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> George, for the first
time entering the conversation.</p>

<p>The stranger looked at him, and evidently did not understand. John
cleared the situation by saying, "I think what you call a pan we call a
dish in Australia."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've panned it often enough; but could not get more than a few
colours to the pan of dirt. Fellows writing me say they go down through
twenty feet of black muck before they strike the gravel and bed-rock. I
was not looking for any proposition like that. How Carmack found out the
gold was underneath I don't know."</p>

<p>The two friends bade their new acquaintance good evening, and returned
to the saloon. All the seats were occupied, and there were yet groups of
men standing about, but the excitement was less. They passed on to the
smoking-room, at the fore-part of the ship. This was crowded, and the
air thick. A large man in a white sweater was holding forth. He was
stout almost to corpulency, and extended his fist excitedly in the
ardour of his argument.</p>

<p>"I tell you, gentlemen," he was saying, "I come from the State of
I-dee-ho. We have big mountains in I-dee-ho, with lots of snow on them
in winter. I've lived among these mountains for twenty years, and I know
what snow is; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> you bet your life if there is one man who will get
into the Yukon it is John Muggsley! Big Jack they called me back home.
It's a big man who is needed on a trip like this, a fellow who can put a
couple of hundred pounds on his back and walk off with it as if it were
nothing. I tell you this is not a proposition for any tenderfoot to
tackle!"</p>

<p>"Well," said another man, "I don't want any packing so far as I am
concerned. I have two cows with me, both good milkers, and I will load
my stuff on their backs and drive them over the pass. I can have their
milk to drink, and when I get to Lake Bennett I'll kill them and sell
their meat."</p>

<p>John and George had seen those cows. Poor cows! Poor man! So it was with
a large portion of the passengers. With the excitement and the thirst
for gold the most quixotic ideas had been developed. What the cows were
to live upon en route had not yet been considered! Such is the haste
with which an idea is acted upon when the gold-fever has seized its
victim.</p>

<p>Others there were who had machine-propelled devices designed to travel
over ice and snow, or on dry land. These machines were manufactured and
sold by keen-witted salesmen to the inexperienced and confiding.</p>

<p>After dinner, that first evening out of port,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> John and George fell into
conversation with the owner of the Malamoots. They had seized two of the
cots erected in the saloon; and their new friend, seeing them, had taken
one next to them. His greeting was friendly.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, getting located?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good act!"</p>

<p>The three were soon in deep conversation, discussing gold-mining as
prosecuted in Australia and in the Yukon. After an hour or two they
strolled forward between the cots, stepping over sacks and bags and
articles of clothing spread upon the floor. They passed several tables
at which games of cards were being played.</p>

<p>"The tin-horns are getting down to business," remarked the stranger.</p>

<p>"What are they playing?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Black Jack, the great game for the tenderfoot. It is so easily learned,
so easy to cheat at, too; and these greenhorns will get robbed-blind."</p>

<p>"Their eyesight will be improved by the loss of their money," remarked
John.</p>

<p>"A fool never learns," said the stranger.</p>

<p>They entered the smoking-room, and found Muggsley still holding forth,
"Gentlemen, you just watch me and see how soon I get over these here
mountains. It's experience that counts in this kind of work."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>The man who had the cows, and he who was the proud possessor of the
Klondike ice-locomotive were listening with some disdain; but the dozen
other listeners were open-mouthed in envy and astonishment at wonderful
Muggsley.</p>

<p>The three passed out on deck. The wind was chill, a frizzle was in the
air, and the waves, breaking in dull phosphorescence against the bow of
the ship, looked sickly and uncanny through the blackness. "A dangerous
coast&mdash;the insurance rate for ships travelling this route is fifteen per
cent.," remarked the stranger.</p>

<p>John Muggsley was still shaking his fist vociferously in the faces of
his listeners as the party returned from deck to seek their beds.</p>

<p>"Good-night, you fellows. Glad I met you. My name's Hugh Spencer," the
stranger said, as he settled in his cot.</p>

<p>"The same to you!" answered the others.</p>

<p>The freemasonry of the gold-seeker holds throughout the world, and its
handshake is honest. Three gold-seekers have been introduced to the
reader in this chapter; and these pages will tell something of what
befell them in what was probably the most spectacular gold-rush in the
history of the world.</p>

<p>John Berwick, who is by way of being our hero, shall have a chapter to
himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>JOHN BERWICK</h3>


<p>Like most men whose success in life is largely the whim of fortune, John
Berwick had for years accepted her rulings without protest, and regarded
passing little incidents as signs of her influence.</p>

<p>One night in the December preceding his setting out for the Klondike, he
was lying in his bunk on Judas Creek&mdash;one of the innumerable streams in
British Columbia in which colours of gold, otherwise "prospects" could
be found&mdash;reading a month old newspaper that a trapper, who had passed
the previous night with him, had brought from the settlement, and in its
columns had found an item of news telling of the recent rich discoveries
in the Yukon. He read the paragraph carefully again and again, striving
to separate exaggeration from truth, and to satisfy himself that there
was truth in it.</p>

<p>By the camp stove sat Joe, the French-Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> whom he employed,
smoking and gazing at the glow of the fire with stolid and witless eyes.
He would sit thus for hours; to a man of Berwick's temperament he was a
satisfactory companion. On the Claim things had gone none too well.
True, by great effort they had reached bed-rock at thirty feet, and were
beginning to cross-cut in search of a pay-streak. There was certainly
little gold in the gravel on the bed-rock already uncovered, and the
flow of water into the working was very great: indeed, as much time was
taken in keeping the shaft free of water as in all their other works
combined. And up to three days previously rain had been incessant,
though relief was apparently at hand, owing to the frost that had
succeeded. The earth had hardened; Judas Creek was already flowing in
less volume, and the boulders in the stream were becoming massed with
ice.</p>

<p>Berwick had been but a few months on Judas Creek, having essayed to try
his fortune in Canada's most western province. Fortune meant much to
him&mdash;for lack of it hindered his marriage with the one necessary girl,
Alice Peel, the only daughter of Surgeon-Major Peel. This was one cause
of his presence on the frontier: another was that he and his religion
had "fallen out" years ago. His father had intended him for the Church,
and here he was....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Creek is falling rapidly, we can hardly hear it now," remarked
John.</p>

<p>"Dat's so," was Joe's reply. He was laconic.</p>

<p>John's thoughts went back to his prospects. Much of his small capital
had gone into the works. Joe was not in love&mdash;he had no capital save his
strength of body, and his religion was negligible. When first this
French-Canadian had arrived in British Columbia, and started work in a
saw-mill, he had refused to work on Sunday, until the foreman told him
that the devil never crossed the Rocky Mountains&mdash;which silenced his
scruples. For sure, the Rocky Mountains were very high!</p>

<p>"I think we should empty the shaft to-morrow with seventy or
seventy-five buckets."</p>

<p>"I guess dat's so."</p>

<p>Again Berwick relapsed into silence, and kept his mind on his many
problems: had he or had he not better throw up his Judas Creek Claim,
and strike out for the scene whence came these wonderful tales?</p>

<p>The volume of the Creek was diminishing with abnormal rapidity. For
three days now frost had been upon the canyon, and the flying spray had
frozen upon the boulders. The rushing, gurgling stream, falling over
rocks and sunken logs, had during that time been sucking down bubbles of
cold air, which sealed the fine ice particles to the river bed. For
miles Judas Creek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> was lined with anchor ice, encasing the rocks with a
coating, sickly, white, insidious. In the darkness the opaque ice seemed
to shine out in phosphorescence; in fact, it threw back the light of the
stars overhead, which seemed to have lowered themselves in the
heavens&mdash;so bright and grand were they.</p>

<p>At a point a mile below the little pool where the nucleus of the mass
now filling the river-bed had formed, a tree was stretched across the
torrent. It had fallen into the stream above, and floated down until it
jammed, holding back the current. The avalanche&mdash;as the thickening
stream had now become&mdash;found this tree, and swept against it but a
second, when it snapped. Now the flow of the river became a seething
mass of ice and sticks&mdash;four feet high&mdash;travelling at the rate of
several miles an hour, picking up all that came in its way. It passed
the mouth of several tributaries, which lent it increase of force: still
its speed quickened: the grinding noise increased&mdash;logs, sticks, masses
of ice and great roots of trees appeared for an instant on its surface
and sank again. Now the wave was five feet&mdash;now six feet
high&mdash;broadening out, gaining yet in speed, still more effectually
holding back the river's flow.</p>

<p>The gradual silencing of the river's roar was getting on the nerves of
John Berwick, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> miles down-stream, far below the ice-flow. The
river had tapered into a little rill.</p>

<p>When a certain noise has been a companion for days and days, and is
suddenly stilled, a sense of uneasiness results, as when on a steamer
the throb of the engine ceasing will rouse sleepers from their slumber.
The slowing down of the torrent in Judas Creek made Berwick restless. He
did not at first recognize what it was that worried him.</p>

<p>Joe also seemed as if he were not altogether proof against the spell; at
last, he took his stare from the stove and looked around the cabin.</p>

<p>"I t'ink something pretty soon happen, by gosh!"</p>

<p>John stared at him; for Joe to volunteer a remark was unusual: it
increased his employer's apprehension.</p>

<p>Berwick returned to his newspaper, fascinated by its news. A party of
miners had arrived in San Francisco bringing much gold from some unknown
region of the north. They called it the Klondike.</p>

<p>Would his Judas Creek Claim ever pay him for his efforts? What were his
chances of fortune? Masses of gold or mountains of dust? He was in
search of fortune&mdash;with a big "F."</p>

<p>His thoughts naturally drifted to the girl he wanted to marry. She was
the daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> luxury and wealth. He was just a prospector, no more in
the eyes of Dame Fortune than the sturdy natural by the stove: in fact,
experience had led him to believe that in the mining enterprise Fortune
had a partiality for such men as Joe.</p>

<p>Berwick had been five years at the mining game. He had drifted from one
camp to another: over America, to Australia, back to America. He had
possibly become something of a cynic; certainly his mind had hardened
with his muscles. He dreamed dreams. What would his lady say if she
received a letter, saying he was again pulling stakes, and had left
Judas Creek in order to avoid being defeated? He whistled, and shrugged
his strong shoulders. He did not know!</p>

<p>He put some practical thoughts together. The Klondike was evidently in
the North, far inland, in Canada. Could he withstand great cold? Yes, he
could; he could endure and do anything as any other normal strong man
could; and could go anywhere that was practicable to humanity. This was
not vanity, not conceit, but just healthy self-confidence.</p>

<p>Should he pull up stakes and leave his Judas Creek Claim to the coyotes?
As this question once more came to his mind, he was aware of the
complete silence now outside, and letting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> paper fall, bent his head
to listen. Joe was listening also. Judas Creek was absolutely still.</p>

<p>Joe arose and opened the cabin door. His employer joined him there.
There was no sound from the Creek; there was no Creek.</p>

<p>"By gosh! dat's funnee t'ing," Joe exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I certainly do not know how to account for it," said Berwick. He felt
apprehensive.</p>

<p>They returned from the cabin door: Joe going to his seat by the stove,
Berwick putting his bed in order for the night, when Joe jumped up and
ran to the door again. A dull distant roar was heard.</p>

<p>"By gosh! By gosh! I got it! He's a river snow-slide what's coming.
Quick, boss&mdash;quick! Get for hell out of dis! Pretty soon no more
cabin&mdash;no windlass&mdash;no, no bucket, only water! No not'ing&mdash;all gone!"</p>

<p>The man began hurriedly putting on his boots, and instinctively his
master followed his example, inquiring as he did so,</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"He's a river snow-slide, dat's all I know for to call him. A havalanche
on wheels, all turn over&mdash;over&mdash;over! Him carry away everything, bridge,
tree, dam&mdash;all sort of thing&mdash;everything go."</p>

<p>And as the sullen roar coming from the valley continued to increase, the
appreciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> approaching danger spread from the one to the other.
Berwick made haste and scrambled into his winter garb. Joe bundled
together his personal effects, and some of the more valuable of the
supplies in the cabin. Berwick did the same; out of the door they sprang
into the night, and up the hillside, under which their cabin was built.
Joe gave a sign when he considered they were out of danger. At once they
threw down their loads and rushed back to the cabin. Grabbing another
load they again sought the higher ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the flood had broken from the canyon at the head of their
little valley. The timber there had been largely cut, and over the
rugged stumps the rolling mass spread, grinding, tearing up the weaker
roots.</p>

<p>Berwick and his companion sat and watched their home going to
destruction. Deliberately, it seemed, the mass of ice and water fell
upon their workings. There was a loud crack as the windlass went down;
and then the fury of water poured into their shaft. It was but for an
instant. The flood tore against their cabin. Would the cabin endure the
shock?</p>

<p>The answer soon came. There was a rending of timber; the cabin was
pushed before the ice; and then it seemed to melt away, swallowed up by
the flood. The lights went out. Lower and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> lower it sank, till the roof
was touched by the surging ice. Then that, too, went under, and nothing
but a fractured log or pole was left of the little home. John shivered.</p>

<p>The flood fell almost as quickly as it had risen, now that its work was
proved effectual. Berwick turned to look at his man. Joe was already
hard at work with an axe on a fallen tree, from which the chips flew.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it now. The Judas Creek venture was a failure:
he could write it down as such. He had known many miners on whom Fortune
had smiled; drunken swine, many of them, to whom money appealed only as
a means to dissipation.</p>

<p>And he, to whom money&mdash;the price of his future home-happiness&mdash;meant so
much!</p>

<p>Joe struck a match, applied it to a handful of birch-bark, and the flame
sprang up.</p>

<p>By all the canons of his life, Berwick should have jumped into the fray
and helped Joe make their camp; but, after all, it was only a little
past nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Yes. Now he must throw up Judas Creek!</p>

<p>Joe laid twigs on top of the birch-bark and soon had a fire, to which he
added larger sticks and logs. Then he cut down a fir-tree and made a
bed, over which he spread the canvas of a tent and blankets. The night
was perfectly clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> they would be warm and snug enough beside the
fire.</p>

<p>Joe cut several more logs of wood and piled them near, after which he
sat down upon the blankets, took off his boots and coat, rolled this
into a pillow, and soon was asleep.</p>

<p>Berwick, sitting by the fire, watched far into the night. His fancy
played about the flames, calling up scenes of his youth, and conceiving
all manner of pictures of the miner's life in the sub-Arctic Klondike
that was to be.</p>

<h3>THE BEGINNING OF YUKON</h3>


<p>No more wonderful system of navigation probably exists on the globe than
that of the inland passage between Puget Sound and the Lynn Canal, at
the head of which are the towns of Skagway and Dyea, the respective
ports of the White and the Chilkoot Passes. For ten hundred miles the
steamers plying along this route run behind the great barrier of
islands, beginning with that of Vancouver and ending at Point Deception.
In summer the trip is grand beyond compare; in winter it is full of
gloom and awe.</p>

<p>As the ship travels northward the mountains grow greater, the narrow
passages narrower, till they develop as canyons, cut only by other
canyon-like passages to the sea, or by glacier-ridden valleys from the
mainland, whose mighty burdens shimmer in the sunlight as they yield in
torrents tributes to the parent ocean. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> summer continuous light
reigns in the latitude of Skagway, and the traveller entering this weird
zone is moved by its uncanny beauty.</p>

<p>Winter was still on the land as the <i>Aleutian</i> ploughed her way
northward, and the passengers saw the great walls of rock uplifting to
the clammy mantle of low-lying clouds. Here and there Indian villages
were passed and Indian graveyards, with flags flying from the stagings,
raised six or eight feet from the ground, on which reposed the deceased.</p>

<p>The ship called at Wrangle and unloaded freight and passengers. "This
town had a boom during the excitement of the Cassiar twenty years back,"
remarked Hugh Spencer to Berwick and Bruce, as the three stood on the
deck and watched the bustle between the steamer and the wharf.</p>

<p>"Let's stretch our legs up the quay," said George. They went ashore.
Squaws were sitting with baskets of their handiwork before them, doing a
lively trade with the disembarked passengers. The sales made were mostly
of moccasins in beads, and bark canoes adorned with porcupine quills of
brightest colours. Hugh stopped before an old squaw and picked up a pair
of large mittens with gauntlet attachments. They were made of canvas and
lined with red flannel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Dollar two bits."</p>

<p>"Give you six bits."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Better take a couple of pair each, fellows; there's nothing like them
for the trail: look how big the thumbs are." So Hugh and his two
companions bought the whole of the squaw's store.</p>

<p>"There's nobody knows how to make mitts for real cold weather like the
Siwash. They make the thumbs good and big, so as not to stop
circulation; and we'll have some cold weather yet before we get over the
summit. But you have to beat the beggars down, as they always ask twice
as much as they expect to get. Here we paid only seventy-five cents a
pair for these mitts, and the squaw said she wanted a dollar and a
quarter for them."</p>

<p>"Are these Siwash<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Indians?" inquired John.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Corruption of the French <i>sauvage</i>.</p></div>

<p>"Well, we call them Siwashes; but they don't like it. The real Siwash
lives farther south, and the name, I believe, is one of contempt."</p>

<p>"They are different Indians from any I have seen on the plains," said
John.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very different. I guess their only resemblance is that they
are both good only when they are dead."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're pretty hard on them," was the remark of the good-natured John.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am. You see, a tough outfit has been trading up here for
years from down the coast; and before that the Russians were here&mdash;and
they didn't put in most of their time building churches. They found a
dollar's worth of hootch would get more from the savages than a dollar's
worth of anything else; so they used whisky. The savage, when you find
him without the cussedness taught by the white man, makes a pretty good
citizen. He may be lazy, but he is honest; and perhaps his laziness is
only due to the fact that he has always had a klootch<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to do chores
around, and has never been trained to the white man's ways of working;
but let any fellow try following an Indian on snow-shoes for a couple of
days, and his ideas soon change. He is not much good with a pick and
shovel for sure; but he is A1 on the trail. Another thing about the
Indian is that when one has grub they all have grub. This is the way of
the Stick Indians inside, and you can cache your grub in their country
or leave the things lying around, and they won't touch them."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Squaw.</p></div>

<p>During the rest of the day John and his mates were in the company of
Hugh Spencer, listening to his tales of Yukon life: the glories of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
summer there, and the great cold of the winter, with the resources of
the miners to keep from despair. He told them the traditions of the
camps, and how the discoveries of '49 in California had been followed by
others in Oregon, British Columbia, the Fort Steele district (Wild Horse
Creek), Kettle River, Caribou, and, finally, in the Yukon.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a miner who was the first finder of gold in the Yukon; it was
a missionary. But the missionary did not follow up this discovery, which
makes a difference. However, I'll tell you the story, and it will let
you see a little of Siwash nature in the telling of it.</p>

<p>"The Rev. Robert Macdonald, Doctor of Divinity and Archdeacon of
MacKenzie River, was the first white man to find gold in the Yukon. Say!
I ain't got much use for missionaries as a general proposition, but
Archdeacon Macdonald is as white a man as ever lived, though he is east
of the Rocky Mountains now. I guess the reason I don't like missionaries
is that you can never do anything with the Siwashes, once a missionary
gets hold of them.</p>

<p>"Well, the Archdeacon&mdash;he wasn't Archdeacon then though&mdash;drifted down
the Porcupine, and took up his residence with the Hudson Bay Company
people at Fort Yukon in the year 1862, which was a few years before I
was born. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> see the Hudson Bay people established themselves at Fort
Yukon in 1847. In 1842 Mr. J. Bell, in charge of the Hudson Bay Post on
the Peel River, which runs into the MacKenzie, from beyond the divide
from the head waters of the Porcupine, crossed over and went down the
Porcupine a way. In 1846 he followed it to its mouth, and saw the Yukon.
In the following year Mr. A. H. Murray built Fort Yukon, and set up
business. Well, it was here that the Archdeacon started to tell the
savages of the Great Spirit&mdash;and they were mighty interested.</p>

<p>"The savages had some sort of a tradition that a certain canyon, which
opened into the Yukon a short distance up stream from the Fort, was the
home of bad spirits; they could hear them groaning, and they asked the
missionary to 'put them wise.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So when a bunch<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> arrived, one day in
July 1863, he trotted the whole outfit off to the canyon.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Inform them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Bunch&mdash;Party.</p></div>

<p>"Of course the missionary found the noises were caused by the wind or
nothing, but, as the Siwashes said there were noises up the Creek, he
said it was the wind.</p>

<p>"Walking along the shore, the Archdeacon saw a bit of something shining
in the gravel and picked it up. It was a flake of gold sticking to a
piece of mica, of which there's lots in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> Klondike country&mdash;mica
schist the scientists call it. So this was the first find of gold by a
white man; but the Company was not looking for gold-hunters in their
country, so the discovery was never followed up.</p>

<p>"The Siwash is A1 at asking questions&mdash;just about as bad as a
six-year-old kid; and if a medicine man comes among them it is
surprising what sort of conundrums they will bring him."</p>

<p>In this way John Berwick and his old-time mining-mate pleasantly passed
the hours listening to the conversation of Spencer, by whom they were
attracted.</p>

<p>On the third evening, at dinner&mdash;the three being seated together&mdash;they
noticed some movement beginning amongst those of the company who were
seated near the companion-way. Several were seen to rise and hurry away.
Quickly the excitement spread, the saloon was soon empty of most of its
feasters.</p>

<p>"Keep your seats, fellows; it's only some chechacho got the toothache,"
said Hugh. Shouts were heard, with a trampling and rush of feet on the
upper deck. "The only thing that could happen&mdash;outside of fire&mdash;would be
to run ashore or hit an iceberg. We are hardly far enough north for the
icebergs yet&mdash;besides, if we had hit one, or run ashore, we should know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
it. If we caught fire, it would not be far to the shore anywhere along
this route; and it is always well not to get stampeded in any case."</p>

<p>After dinner the friends entered the main saloon, and found groups of
men talking excitedly, with others returning from the upper deck where
the life-boats were stored. To the upper deck they went, and there they
found Mr. Muggsley.</p>

<p>"I tell you, gentlemen, no officer or anybody else is going to keep me
from the life-boats when a ship is sinking. I don't care for anybody!
You stand by and let the officers and sailors run things&mdash;and they will
fill the boats with women and their own friends&mdash;and look out for
themselves. But I look out for John Muggsley! Big John Muggsley the boys
call me! And it's a case like this that makes me glad I'm big and
strong."</p>

<p>An excitable coal-heaver had found a stream of water entering by a
sea-cock, which had been left open through carelessness; and, running up
through the saloon to the boats, had started the excitement. Such
trivial circumstances often cause most disastrous panics; and likewise
tell tales of how certain men are made!</p>

<p>The ship eventually&mdash;after blinding snowstorms&mdash;entered Gastineau
Channel. To the left was the great line of stamp mills pounding out the
wealth of the mighty Treadwell quartz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> deposits on Douglas Island; to
the right was the pioneer town of Juneau, with its gambling-halls and
saloons enjoying the licence of the Alaska mining-camp.</p>

<p>The next stop for the ship was Skagway, where the sea journey would end
on the morrow. The passengers were alert and astir. From then on it was
to be a struggle.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>SOCIETY IN ALASKA</h3>


<p>The weather had changed during the night; and as the two friends stepped
on deck the following morning a chill and cutting wind met them from the
north. Away above them towered the mountains, their peaks dazzling white
against the sky. Behind them, to the south, was the Lynn Canal, walled
with mountains. Before them were mountains, and yet more mountains. The
cluster of tents and hastily constructed buildings, resting on a few
square miles of gravel flats&mdash;comprising the town of Skagway&mdash;were
robbed of any importance by the great uplifting walls of rock.</p>

<p>As they stood a voice hailed them. "Is this Skagway?" It was Mr.
Muggsley who spoke.</p>

<p>"I fancy so," said John; "better ask the purser&mdash;here he comes."</p>

<p>"Do we have to climb those mountains to get to the Klondike?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"But where is the White Pass?"</p>

<p>"There." The purser pointed to the mouth of a valley, which soon
appeared blocked by a mighty mountain.</p>

<p>"And that is the White Pass?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Say, purser, is that berth I had taken for the trip down again? If not,
save it for me. I guess I'm wanted back in I-dee-ho."</p>

<p>Mr. Muggsley, the big man, the strong man, "Big Jack," as his friends
called him, was suddenly possessed of "cold feet." The great uplifting
mountains with their glittering peaks flung to heaven had quickened the
cowardice of his craven soul.</p>

<p>Berwick and his comrade struggled ashore through the rushing
freight-handlers and piled-up supplies. The freight which came from the
Canadian port, Vancouver, had to be passed by the United States Customs,
and the officers seemed few. There was a method of overcoming the
Customs&mdash;by employing a "convoy," an official of the United States
Customs, to escort the goods across the narrow strip into Canadian
territory again. John made inquiries, and addressed a fellow in a wild
garb, bespeaking a resident.</p>

<p>"Pay the duty, partner! These escort fellows are a bunch of grafters!
They ain't no credit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> the United States, I can tell you. Yes, pay
duty, and hand an officer a ten-dollar bill on the side, or they'll keep
you here a week, you bet!"</p>

<p>John decided to pay the duty. The convoy would cost $5.00 per day and
expenses. He made an effort to get his goods passed, but without
success&mdash;till he paid the ten-dollar bribe. George did the same. John
did not like bribery; but&mdash;what else could he do?</p>

<p>It was afternoon ere they got through; and as they gained the town, a
rough board-building with a great white cloth sign painted on
it&mdash;"Restaurant, meals 50 cents"&mdash;met their gaze from the head of the
wharf. Other buildings of similar character composed generally this
section of the town, so they walked into the first.</p>

<p>It was a box of a place, as unfinished internally as externally. A dozen
or so men, perched on high stools, were leaning against a board counter
covered with white oilcloth. Behind the counter stood a woman and a
girl; a range, where the chef was operating, at their back. A board
partition divided off a sleeping apartment. The curtain that gave the
room privacy was but half drawn. Articles of clothing, trunks, and boxes
were strewn in disorder on the floor.</p>

<p>"Soup?" queried the lady as they took their seats. The cook filled two
flat tin plates with a watery solution of tomatoes and rice. This they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
attacked. When the soup was finished two other tin plates were handed
them, laden with cubical chunks of beef and gravy. Dishes of potatoes
and boiled beans, with bread and butter in tin bowls, were lined upon
the counter for each man to help himself from. At the end of the second
course a plate, bearing a quarter section of sickly-looking apple-pie,
was slid over to each.</p>

<p>The old lady presiding wore the smile of prosperity, and looked
communicative, so John opened conversation. "Been in Skagway long?"</p>

<p>"Just a month."</p>

<p>"Doing well?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing! feed about three hundred people a day. Don't care if the
rush never lets up."</p>

<p>"You've got a gold-mine here without the trouble of going to Dawson."</p>

<p>"Sure!&mdash;that is if Soapy don't put the whole town out of business. He
makes the saloons and gambling-halls pay him royalty now, besides
running shows himself; and I guess he'll be after us soon to make us
anti-up too."</p>

<p>"I thought Alaska was a prohibition territory, no whisky sold here."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what they say back East; but when you get up town you'll
find every second place a saloon with all the hootch you want to drink,
or have money to pay for."</p>

<p>"But how do they get the whisky?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy enough. The hootch is consigned through to the Canadian
side in bond; but when it is landed here they drill a hole in the barrel
and take out the whisky. They refill the barrel with water, and it is
packed over the summit."</p>

<p>"But it costs thirty cents a pound to put the water over the summit!"</p>

<p>"That don't matter&mdash;with whisky fifty cents a glass over the bar."</p>

<p>"Don't the officers know this is going on?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing they do; but they 'stand in. There is no graft like a whisky
graft."</p>

<p>"Stand in" and "graft"!&mdash;the two Australians felt they knew the meaning
of the terms, but they had yet to grasp how deep the meaning of
"standing in" and "grafting," as understood by officialdom in Alaska and
the Yukon, could be.</p>

<p>Berwick and his friend ate their pie, and departed to see the sights.</p>

<p>The main street of the town ran due north and south, and was lined with
tents and buildings, finished and under construction. The street was
devoid of snow, except in patches here and there; the ever-persistent
wind from the north having generally swept the gravel clean. Sleighs,
drawn by dogs or horses, passed smoothly over the ice, but shrieked in
protest against the stone. Dogs and horses seemed everywhere in that
rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> of fifty thousand men. No man could enter the Yukon without a
year's provisions, which meant that he must transport at least a
thousand pounds in every case.</p>

<p>Along the streets vehicles were waiting to transport vast stores of
supplies to White Pass City, twelve miles distant; after which dog-teams
alone, or pack-animals, or the labour of the human animal, were
necessary. Some pack-horses, mules, and burroes were passing down the
streets to their stables, after having carried up their loads.</p>

<p>Men in outlandish garb were walking about; many wore what appeared to be
night-shirts coming down to their knees, with hoods attached, and rings
of fur around the wrists and the face of the hood. Some of the peculiar
garments were made of blue drill, others even of bed-ticking, showing
its dingy stripes. This garment was the parka.</p>

<p>Berwick and Bruce entered the Pack-Train Saloon and Gambling-hall, and
met there the leaders of Alaska society: men and women of diverse morals
and immoralities. In the great grab-bag system of the goldfields every
man has an equal chance; and on the frontier custom affords but one
field of diversion, which each may enjoy to the full extent of his purse
and inclination. As muscle and endurance alone give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> eminence on the
trail, so only money and extravagance command attention in the bar-room
and at the gaming-table; and it is there that the illiterate squander
their money over the bars and tables, finding pleasure in the
open-mouthed admiration of the yokel as well as in the stimulation of
the liquor or the excitement of the play.</p>

<p>At the bar of the Pack-Train stood a row of men, in widest diversity of
costume, talking together and to women numbered among the fallen. Behind
the bar were the roulette-wheel, the faro, the Black Jack tables, and
the crap game. A large percentage of these men were actively engaged in
putting supplies over the Passes, and were now squandering at the tables
the money received in payment of that work. The thought struck John that
probably not a man of them, wasting his money there, but had some one
dependent to whom that money would be as a gift from heaven. Alas, for
the recklessness of frontier life, where it so often happens that men
regard a show of contempt for money as tantamount to personal eminence!
Such scenes were not new to him. On the plains in his apprenticeship he
had seen a cowboy shoot his revolver through a bar mirror&mdash;and
cheerfully pay the exorbitant recompense demanded by the proprietor: and
in Sydney he had watched a drunken sailor place a five-pound note
between two slices of bread&mdash;and eat it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Such scenes as this in the mushroom Alaska town may be ever-interesting
to the students of human nature; they are also intensely pitiable, as
Berwick found. What sight is sadder than that which shows man degraded,
or woman fallen? Man, the noblest being in all creation; upbuilt,
evolved through the ages; practically perfect in his parts: his body
complex yet true; delicate and confident, enriched with a mind capable
of holding dominion; and conscious of the inspiration of his Creator. To
see him, mind and body, lost to dissipation, drawn from hope, truth, and
love, fallen into the mire, is truly sadder than death.</p>

<p>From the Pack-Train Saloon the two friends visited several shops, and,
notwithstanding the crowds therein, succeeded in adding to their
supplies such necessities as were recommended by Hugh Spencer. Their
purchases completed, they turned before the wind and went back to the
restaurant. The air had taken on a greater chill; the mountain peaks
shone with sunset gold.</p>

<h3>SOAPY'S LITTLE GAME</h3>


<p>"Soapy" Smith was a criminal, with a long record of robbery and murder.
In early life he had been a common "faker" and sold soap, hence his
sobriquet. His process consisted of wrapping small bits of laundry soap
in paper, and including&mdash;or appearing to include&mdash;with several of the
pieces a bank bill of varying value. Then he would mix all the pieces
together, and picking a handful out of the mass, auction them. Needless
to say every successful purchaser was a confederate!</p>

<p>In the Mining Camps of the Western States he later took more radical
methods, making many enemies and some friends. When he and his gang
wished to exterminate an enemy they would hunt him out in some saloon,
gather about him, and play at fighting among themselves. Revolvers would
be drawn and shots fired&mdash;the man "wanted" would be killed. It would be
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>what hard to find the actual man who fired the fatal shot, and, in
any case, a subservient jury would bring in a verdict of "accidental"
death.</p>

<p>The community that grew at the head of the Lynn Canal in the spring of
1898 was a complete hotbed for crime. There Soapy Smith established
himself, and law and justice ceased to exist. Gold-seekers were enticed
into games, and fleeced or openly robbed in the streets. Every saloon
was owned by the desperado, or paid him tribute, and he drew revenue
from every gambling-table.</p>

<p>Soapy Smith was the boss of these evil conditions. He was styled
"Colonel," and spoken of as a candidate for Congress. A body of United
States Regulars were stationed at Skagway, but did nothing. The Deputy
United States Marshal would make promises, but take no action.</p>

<p>The second evening after the arrival of our party in Skagway the sky was
overcast, and through the night a storm arose. So they stayed within
doors all the next day; but towards night inaction told on them,
likewise lack of fresh air. They became restless after their evening
meal, and George finally said: "Let us go out"&mdash;and they went. George
did not say where&mdash;nor did John ask. There was only one place to go to,
and that was a saloon and gambling-hall: one was much the same as the
other. Every saloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> was a gambling-hall: every gambling-hall a saloon.</p>

<p>On the next night, in the vicinity of Skagway's Sixth Avenue, they
wandered into a saloon which had no sign: the question of what its name
was did not cross their minds! The air was foul, and floor space not too
plentiful. Women stared at them, and "Passed them up." Not so the men.
They moved on to the gaming-tables. John threw a coin on to the Black
Jack table. To his surprise he won. He speculated again: again he won.
Then he remembered the old dodge of letting the novice win a bit at
first, so he decided he would keep on until he found himself losing.
When he had won twenty dollars he put the money into his pocket, and
went on with George to watch a man playing for heavy stakes at roulette.
At this table there was never a word spoken, and the gold pieces passed
from banker to player, from player to banker, without comment.</p>

<p>While the two were looking on they noticed a man come and stand by the
banker, watch the game for a little while, glance shrewdly at them, and
go away. Shortly afterwards another man did the same. John and George
realised this attention, but said nothing. A third man came along, and
bluntly asked them,</p>

<p>"Ever play roulette?"</p>

<p>"No; at least not often," said John.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good game."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ever shoot craps?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"There's a table down at the end of the hall. Care to see it?"</p>

<p>They followed their entertainer to the dimly-lighted rear, where several
men were leaning over a table throwing dice. They watched the game a
bit, and found it uninteresting. They turned to go, when their new
acquaintance made a move to follow&mdash;and asked in a hesitating way, "Have
a drink?"</p>

<p>George declined.</p>

<p>The fellow pondered a bit, and then said in an ingratiating way, "Would
you fellows like to see a big mountain goat I bought from the Siwashes
to-day?"</p>

<p>John and George followed the man through a doorway into a cold room
where a few candles were burning on a rough table. On the floor lay an
immense mountain goat.</p>

<p>"My word!" said George, "what a beauty!"</p>

<p>They stood for some minutes surveying the dead monarch of the mountain
crests, their entertainer taking one of the candles and holding it at
the animal's head. Suddenly they heard groans, which appeared to come
through the doorway at the opposite end of the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>The man took a candle and walked to the door, bending his head, as if
listening intently. The groans were continued. John and George went over
to him. He held the candle in his left hand, and appeared to haul at the
door with his right. "Oh! Oh!" came from the room in tones of deepest
distress. The fellow handed the candle to John, and then, catching the
door with both hands, gave it a mighty wrench. The heavy plank door
opened and showed a dark cavity, which drank up the slender light of the
candle so effectually that they could distinguish nothing. Cautiously
John entered, followed by George. The door was slammed; they were
trapped.</p>

<p>"We're caught! Soapy has us," exclaimed George.</p>

<p>John turned, shaded the candle with his hand, and explored the room. It
was not large, and it took him but a minute to make a circuit of the
four walls.</p>

<p>"We're caught!" was said again.</p>

<p>"But there is no one here: where did the groans come from?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Don't know, if they weren't ventriloquism," replied George.</p>

<p>That seemed likely. John ran and gave the door a kick: it was solid as a
wall.</p>

<p>"What will they do with us?" he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Freeze us to death; we'll freeze quick enough in this atmosphere."</p>

<p>The place was cold, clammy, benumbing. The walls were log; the floor of
earth, sparkling with frost crystals; the roof was built of poles. There
was no window. Here and there, where the crevices of the logs had not
been thoroughly filled, and the air came in, there were patches of
frost. They searched for some implement. The room was thoroughly
bare&mdash;there was not even a billet of wood, let alone an axe, or saw.
Things were at a pass. They were both to perish in horrible death. The
cold was seizing them. They stamped up and down the room, and shouted.
There was, there could be, no answer.</p>

<p>Frenzy came over them. Trapped! To perish of bitter cold! Horrible!...
Horrible! To famish as caged animals. They saw their little destiny&mdash;to
walk, and walk, and walk, and then to lie down and sleep till death, the
reality, came. Their impotency galled them. How weak were their arms and
strength against these walls of logs!</p>

<p>They marched about for an hour or more, encouraging each other as brave
men will.</p>

<p>Then cries were heard faintly from the outside, and new noises, which
grew, and continued to grow. A great blow shook the wall, and then
another. John shouted; George shouted; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> blows were repeated; then
they heard voices and shouted again. The door was burst open and in
rushed a number of men.</p>

<p>"Come, fellows, out of this, or you'll be cooked!"</p>

<p>It was the voice of Hugh.</p>

<p>They eagerly followed him through the room where the goat was, and out
through a side door into the open, where a great glare met them. An
outhouse was on fire. Men were rushing about and shouting; but Hugh kept
on through the crowd, and the rescued followed him till they reached the
safety of the street.</p>

<p>"Now we'd better duck for home," said Spencer. "I go with you"; and
through the storm they struggled till they reached the Frau's
restaurant.</p>

<p>She had not yet retired, so they called for supper&mdash;tea, bacon, and
beans. After they had settled down Hugh told his story.</p>

<p>"You see, fellows, after I landed I went over to the Chilkoot to have a
look at things there; but after talking to the fellows I reckoned that
the White Pass was best for me, so back I comes. I was in the hall
to-night with you fellows, but you did not see me; and I thought I would
just lay back and see if you would hit the games. Then I kind of got a
notion Soapy's men were watching you; so I thought I would watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> the
whole outfit. I see you go back to the crap-game, and then I see you go
into the room with your bunco man&mdash;and then I don't see you come out; so
I said to myself, you are there for keeps! Now there was with me one
fellow I could rely on, so I asked him to keep an eye on that door, and
I got out on the street to size up the building. I see towards the rear
the wing you went into, so I walks down there, sizing things up. Round
on the back side I see a door and a window, but the door had the snow
piled up against it&mdash;besides, I knew they would not lock you in a room
with a window in it, as you could easily kick that out.</p>

<p>"Then I looks at the walls, and I see by the end of the logs sticking
out that there was a room which had neither window nor door to the
outside, and I said, 'That's the cage!' So I ran back to the saloon and
asked my friend there if anybody had come out, and he said 'No.' I came
to the conclusion that I would make a bluff of going in at the door you
came out of. It was no good; a fellow stopped me and said, 'This room is
private.' This made me sure you were still there, so I commenced
figuring out how I could get you free, and I thought hard. The thing was
to get a crowd together; and as a dog fight is no good in Skagway in the
middle of the night&mdash;especially in a snowstorm&mdash;I said to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>self,
'Fire!' I remembered a building I took for a wood-shed lying near your
skookum house,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> so I just hunted it up, and after finding there was a
lot of wood in it, with some hay, I set a match to it, and got out,
taking an axe with me. In five minutes it was going fine, and I yelled
'Fire! fire! fire!' Then it was all easy. I struck the logs with the
axe, and yelled there was somebody in there who would get burned; I
busted in the door to the outer room, and then the one into where you
were locked up&mdash;the other fellows following. I don't know what the other
fellows around the fire will think you were doing in there; but I guess
they won't ask any questions. Fellows don't ask questions in Soapy's
town; it doesn't do them much good if they do."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> "Skookum House": Chinook Indian term for prison&mdash;literally
"strong" house.</p></div>

<p>John and George expressed their gratitude very simply.</p>

<p>"I am going in over the White Pass," he continued, "and I figure, as us
fellows can't keep clear of each other, that we'd better join forces."</p>

<p>"Done!" cried George.</p>

<p>"A good idea!" said John.</p>

<p>So it was agreed.</p>

<p>In the morning details were talked over, and business was arranged.
Additional purchases were made, including two more dogs, thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
named Tom and Jerry. Hugh induced his friends to part with much of their
bedding, saying he had a large lynx-skin robe that was warmer than a
dozen pairs of blankets, under which the three might sleep. A
waterproof, a large tanned moose-skin, and a couple of pairs of blankets
would be sufficient to lie upon. Then the commissariat was considered.
Sugar, tea, evaporated potatoes, dried fruit, etc., to be used in the
preparation of every meal, were put into small canvas bags, and those
into a large sack. The general stores were put away in waterproof canvas
sacks, which were marked to indicate contents. The axes of the party
were ground and sharpened. At last all was ready for the advance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>HITTING THE TRAIL</h3>


<p>To be early on the trail was an essential to Hugh Spencer. He was up at
four on the morning of the start, harnessed the dogs, carried the outfit
to the sleigh, and lashed it on. Then he aroused his friends, who, when
dressed, found that an early breakfast had been arranged for them of
bacon, eggs, and beans.</p>

<p>"Better put lots next your ribs, for there isn't room to cook a meal on
the trail between here and White Pass City," was the advice they
received.</p>

<p>They left the restaurant, after a kindly good-bye from the old lady.
John and George tied their hand-bags, containing underclothing, towel,
soap, etc., and socks to the load. The main portion of their extra
clothing was left in the general supplies.</p>

<p>Of the five dogs he of the stub tail&mdash;Dude the leader&mdash;was the only one
that appeared to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> an interest in the proceedings, for he was
standing watching his master. The others were mere balls of fur lying in
the snow. Hugh went ahead and harnessed himself in the cord that was
tied to the front of the sleigh, and grasped the "gee-pole," lashed as a
single shaft on the right side of the sleigh.</p>

<p>"Mush," he ordered. Dude gave a tug at the traces, and the other dogs
stood up.</p>

<p>"Mush," was ordered again. The whole five dogs strained at the traces,
in a half-hearted sort of way, not sufficient to move the load. Hugh
then let go his hold of the pole, threw off his harness, and picked up a
whip that was tucked under the lashings of the load. Behind Dude was Two
Bits; then came Four Bits, Tom and Jerry. Beginning with Two Bits, he
gave each a cut with the whip, causing heart-rending howls; but Dude
stood throughout the ordeal, evidently oblivious to the sufferings of
his companions; his tongue protruding. He was a picture of conscious
virtue. Dude knew these signs of the trail, the stern, hard life, the
cut of the whip, the cry of the dog.</p>

<p>Hugh then cracked the whip, re-harnessed himself in the cord, and
grasped the gee-pole.</p>

<p>"Mush," he ordered. The five dogs strained at the traces, taking quick,
furtive glances over their shoulders at the man with the whip. The load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
moved; the march towards the great and golden Klondike had started.</p>

<p>Early as they were they saw, as they reached the main street, others on
the trail; and up the long avenue heading north between the great
mountains horse-teams, dog-teams, and men unaided were drawing their
loads. The wind was roaring down the pass, cutting their faces like a
knife. They now appreciated the special virtues of the parka, for with
hood drawn over their head, as they bent before the gale, their faces
largely escaped the cutting blasts; and the light material of which the
garment was made was wonderfully effective in keeping the wind from
their bodies.</p>

<p>Although the recent storm had improved the travelling, it was not long
before the sleigh grated on gravel and stopped, the dogs appearing
instinctively to realize that the noise meant further effort was
useless. Hugh said nothing, but disengaged himself from his harness,
went to the rear of the load, and undid a coil of rope from either side,
to which Berwick and Bruce were harnessed also. He then resumed his
position. "Mush!" The three men and five dogs threw themselves against
the load. There was a shriek from the gravel, and the sleigh glided
again over the soft snow.</p>

<p>The difficulty being over, Hugh told his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> to disengage
themselves and throw the cords back on the load, which they did, after
protesting that they had better remain in harness and help to pull.</p>

<p>"No, you fellows can each take a turn at the gee-pole when I get tired,"
Hugh said.</p>

<p>The dogs would stop for any excuse; it was only necessary for Hugh to
pass the time of day with a south-bound traveller, when the train would
stand, their tongues lolling out, their eyes vacantly staring. 'Tis the
nature of the beast. The native dogs of the north never give the
impression that they work because they feel it their duty. They work
because they know there is a stronger will than theirs behind them, a
will with a whip.</p>

<p>The party moved steadily along for a mile or two, when the road left the
flats and took to the side hill at the right hand of the canyon. A
considerable amount of work had been done, and the trail was in good
shape; but they had not gone far before they were met by a toll-gate.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five cents each, and two dollars and a half for the dog-team,"
was demanded of them, which they paid. The keeper of the toll-gate
seemed happy; he was prospering, and those who employed him were making
money. John and George thought the charge excessive, but Hugh was
exercising his wits, calculating how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> much the proprietors made out of
what he called their "graft."</p>

<p>Not far beyond the toll-gate they met an old man sitting by a fire under
the lee of a wall of rock. He was off the trail in a sort of little
cove, and on the much-betramped snow around was a sleigh, and by it five
goats in harness. The old man merely looked up as the three friends
approached, and went on poking the fire.</p>

<p>"Well, partner, enjoying the scenery?" asked Hugh, in his good-natured
manner.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I wish I was dead."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"These ornery goats here, I can't do nothing with them, an' if it wasn't
for poor little Bess, back home, I'd shoot them and meself too."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Well, the ornery critters won't pull a pound, and the fellow who sold
them to me down in Seattle said they was just the thing for the
Pass&mdash;better'n dogs, for I could feed them on birch browse; but I lit
out from Skagtown<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> four days ago and could get no further than this. I
pretty near had to pull sleigh and goats too to get this far; and I
pitched camp here, where I've stayed ever since. You see it's this
way&mdash;the old woman died last fall, and after she died the poor old farm
went plumb to pieces, hard times, and mortgage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> falling due; so I got a
sickening of the old place without the old woman, and I let the farm go
and put little Bess to school for a year, and lit out for the Klondike.
Bess ain't Bess by rights; she was christianized Matilda Jane, and we
called her Bess for short. Well, the old woman was always building on
bringing up Bess a real lady, and afore she died I promised I'd give
Bess a good schooling and help all I could, and I took to the Klondike,
hearing all a fellow had to do was to get there, and he'd be rich. Here
I am now, and I ain't got no more money. I'm just trying to make up my
mind to shoot the blamed goats and pull my stuff back to Skagtown and
sell it. Then I guess I'll go packing on the Chilkoot along with the
Siwashes."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Skagway</p></div>

<p>The old man seemed to forget the presence of the strangers, and
muttered, "Poor little Bess! Poor little Bess! I was hoping to make her
a real lady with silks, an' satins, an' diamonds, an' kid gloves, an'
fancy eye-glasses."</p>

<p>Hugh cracked the whip, John tightened on the cord, the dogs threw
themselves into the traces; and the trio was on its way up the Pass. No
one spoke for some time; each was thinking of the old man's tale, and of
such as that old man there were hundreds in the Passes.</p>

<p>The trail, as they struggled along, proved to be more and more built
against the side hill, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> frequently the sleigh showed a disposition
to slide into the canyon, so that all were compelled to give attention
to it. But the three men taking turn at the gee-pole, they had soon
crossed Kill-a-man Creek, and were at the foot of Porcupine Hill. The
time had passed quickly, and the air, though cold, was highly
stimulating. George and John voted the parka a wonderful garment.</p>

<p>Arriving at the base of the hill, Hugh quickly undid the fastenings,
piled half the load on the side of the trail, and relashed the balance
to the sleigh; then he and John set about the task of taking the first
load to the top of the hill, while George mounted guard at the base.
Hugh took the gee-pole, John harnessed himself in the cord that was
attached to the left-hand rear of the sleigh; so they set out.</p>

<p>The hill made a rise of several hundred feet in the first quarter of a
mile, and in some places seemed almost standing on end; but straining,
pulling, tugging, men and dogs both, they eventually reached the top.
They soon had the sleigh unloaded, and Hugh was off down again for the
remainder of the load. In three-quarters of an hour they were all
together again. Then began the descent, which was almost as acute as the
rise had been. They adjusted the necessary brakes by tying a piece of
rope around each runner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving the summit of Porcupine Hill they had a good look at the
view. Across the valley in front, set in a basin of the mountains, was a
collection of buildings and tents, constituting White Pass City. Two
long lines of men and teams marked the White Pass, one on the left side
of the canyon, the other on the canyon bottom. The hillside trail was
used by horses, mules, and oxen, while in the wedge-like canyon bottom
men and dogs toiled. The reason for the hillside trail was that its
ascent was more gradual, the lower trail having many abrupt rises up
which horses and oxen could not clamber.</p>

<p>The scene of toil and labour, backed by the sublimity of the
surroundings, impressed the beholders; but the party came to life again
with Hugh's order, "Mush!"</p>

<p>The dogs struggled with the load over the brink of the decline down
which the sleigh quickly passed, and the party was not long in reaching
White Pass City. This was the first depot out from Skagway, and was
distant there-from twelve miles. From White Pass City to Lake Bennett
the distance was twenty-four miles, so they were now one-third of the
way. But the twelve miles they had passed was the easiest part of the
journey.</p>

<p>Saloons and restaurants in wide array, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> numerous stables in the
shape of tents tied down and guyed against the ever-recurring blasts,
comprised White Pass City. And how the wind did blow from the
funnel-shaped canyon across the basin in which the town was built!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the cold, beasts of burden were standing in all
directions, tied to posts and rails, while the dogs seemed without
number. It being now late in the day, there were more teams returning
from the summit and Bennett than were setting out. Amongst those
returning they met a man with a dozen pack-mules. Long icicles hung from
his moustache, powdery snow was driven into the folds of his parka, his
cheeks were alternate patches of blue and crimson. His manner was
blustering, because he was glad at having returned, and proud that he
had done so without losing any horses.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Hugh, "what's it like on the summit?"</p>

<p>"What's it like! Look here, stranger, if I owned hell and that summit,
I'd sell the summit and live in hell, so help me! What's the matter with
the summit? Why, if that cursed wind ain't blowing from the north cold
enough to freeze hell, then it's blowing from the south and snowing as
if all the feather beds in the New Jerusalem were being split open and
shaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> loose. I'll be hanged if the Mounted Police ain't got a stable
and store-house scooped out under the snow, and the roof standing up
like as if it was a rock. About sixty feet of snow has fallen up there
this winter; and how them poor devils of policemen hold things down in
tents is more than I know. A fellow can tackle it for a day or two, but
these fellows have been up there since early in February!"</p>

<p>"It's a way they have in the Army," suggested George, always an ardent
Briton.</p>

<p>"Those fellows are different from any Army fellows I ever seed," was the
stranger's reply.</p>

<p>The pack-train was called to a halt. The communicative stranger and his
assistants were taking the saddles off the mules; but for once the dogs
were impatient and restless: instinct told them they were near the end
of their day's work and the prospect of food. So Hugh let them have
their way, and they drew up in front of a restaurant which bore the
legend, "Meals, seventy-five cents."</p>

<p>"Better go in and eat, fellows, and I'll look after the dogs," said
Hugh.</p>

<p>His friends demurred, but he insisted; so they entered the restaurant.</p>

<p>There was the same motley crowd feeding in the same savage manner as at
Skagway. Everybody smoked on the trail&mdash;in all places and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> under any
condition&mdash;save where the pipe froze and refused its duty.</p>

<p>The hour was between two and three. Berwick and his comrade thought they
had never been so hungry. How they relished the hot soup, and the meat,
potatoes, and beans! And when they drank ...! George finished his dinner
first, and scrambled off to relieve Hugh, whom he found cutting up
pieces of raw meat for the dogs.</p>

<p>"Raw meat ain't any too good for dogs, but after they get over the
summit they will get down to boiled rice and tallow&mdash;and that ain't far
off."</p>

<p>Hugh was certainly the favourite of the dogs just then, but soon after
George's arrival he put the piece of meat he had been dividing into a
sack and threw it on the sleigh, and hurried to the restaurant, saying
that he would boil the rest of the meat for the dogs after he himself
had something to eat. "Look out for Soapy's gang" was his final warning
to George.</p>

<p>After Hugh had his dinner (dinner is the mid-day, supper the evening,
meal on the trail) he remarked that he would take a mooch round. When he
returned he greeted his friends with:</p>

<p>"Say, I found a fellow I know here running one of these stables, and he
has a tent with a lot of hay in it, and says we can sleep in that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
which will save us making camp. We can put the dogs inside and run less
chances of having them stolen; also the grub."</p>

<p>So Dude was aroused from his sleep; four other doggy noses were
withdrawn from under four bushy tails, and to the accompaniment of howls
the load was removed to the hay-tent, the dogs unharnessed, the load
unpacked. Hugh undid the bedding and spread it on a pile of straw.</p>

<p>"This will be the last bed we'll strike for some time after we leave
here," was his remark.</p>

<p>He grabbed the sack with the meat, and went off to see if he could find
space on a stove to boil it. He soon returned with the meat, as well as
a bucket in which were canine dainties&mdash;kitchen scraps.</p>

<p>"Chuck it into you," was Hugh's remark to the dogs as he threw them the
food; "you'll have to work to-morrow."</p>

<p>As there was nothing to do now till that morrow, the three again
strolled out to look at the trail, up which the full flow of traffic was
now toiling. Profanity filled the air. The travellers cursed the trail;
they cursed their horses, cursed their dogs, the wind, the country
generally.</p>

<p>They wandered into a saloon, which, as ever, was reeking with tobacco,
and vibrating to the notes of "Home, sweet Home," reeled off on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
gramophone. Hugh looked cautiously at the company. "Soapy's men!" he
whispered; so he and his companions went. John noticed that a good deal
of money was being won at the tables; but Hugh told him that the men who
were winning were Soapy's staff.</p>

<p>"They seem to run a wonderful system," said John.</p>

<p>"Yes; Soapy pretty nearly owns the whole shop from the Lynn Canal to the
summit."</p>

<p>"But why does he stop at the summit?"</p>

<p>"Police."</p>

<p>"But they have police on this side."</p>

<p>"Not the same."</p>

<p>"How do you account for that?"</p>

<p>"Don't know: discipline! The Canadian police are not grafting. Fellows
I've met from the inside tell me that Cap Constantine gave records for
all the rich claims in Bonanza, and neither he nor any of the rest of
the Mounted Police grafted any. That's what I call honest; but now,
since the records have been taken away from the police, there's nothing
but grafting going on. Fellows have to give up half interest in claims
to the officials before they can get record; and even the Government is
grafting officially with this ten per cent. royalty. If some of those
Members of Parliament back in Canada were here, with this proposition,
getting over these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> Passes, they'd think they had a right to all they'd
found in this country. And now they are taking part of it away&mdash;it's a
shame, I call it."</p>

<p>They had walked up the lower trail leading to the summit. Whatever men
and horses were to be seen were making down the Pass, for the trail that
clung to the side of the mountain was so narrow that two horses, going
in opposite directions, could not pass each other; so in the morning the
horses passed up the trail, and in the afternoon down. That was the
unwritten law. They returned to the sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>Every dog, except Dude, had his nose under his tail, and was apparently
oblivious to all outside concerns. Dude's tail was not long enough to
cover his nose, and Hugh noticed his eyes quiver and open slightly. On
the floor was the empty meat sack. The five dogs had demolished the
large piece of dead horse.</p>

<p>"That's Dude," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"Which?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Why, stealing that meat. Before we get to Dawson you'll know what a
high-class article in the stealing line he is. However, there'll be lots
more dead horses: they kill about a dozen a day between here and
Bennett."</p>

<p>"How do they manage that?"</p>

<p>"Wait till to-morrow, and you'll see."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>HUGH'S PHILOSOPHY</h3>


<p>The stars were still shining when the friends tore themselves, stiff and
sore, from under their lynx-skin robe on the morrow to dress in the
chill atmosphere of the tent; but the sounds of movement were
everywhere. Commands, embellished with profanity, were being shouted.
When the three adventurers, after a hurried breakfast, eagerly went out
a sickly light was spreading over the mountains, which seemed spectral
and immense.</p>

<p>"We'll take the flour, sugar, and hardware in the first two loads,"
remarked Hugh, as he began selecting these supplies; "and it won't do
any harm to hang our bacon sack from a rafter while we are away, as a
stray malamoot might get in here. These blamed dogs will chew a tin can
open to get at the meat inside."</p>

<p>The plan of campaign suggested by Hugh and endorsed by the others was to
divide the sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>plies in three loads; to take two, comprising the reserve
stores, to the summit and cache them; then, on the following day, to
carry the remainder of the stuff right through to Log Cabin, or to
Bennett if they could manage it, and establish a camp there. This
depended on the condition of the trail.</p>

<p>Early as they were, there were scores of outfits setting out, and many
were ahead of them.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they met two men and a dog-team; one of the
men was belabouring the dogs with a whip, making them howl dreadfully.
Dude and the rest of the team halted, and, with their masters, watched
the proceedings. The dogs belaboured were soon tangled among the traces
in fine confusion. Each animal, as he saw a stroke coming his way,
jumped sideways with a howl and buried his nose and feet in the snow.
The cruelty aroused the anger of John and George, who made a move
towards the brute with the whip. Hugh caught him by the arm and pulled
him back.</p>

<p>"Better not make yourself a Humane Society in this country; you'll only
get into trouble&mdash;besides, he ain't hurting the dogs: wait!"</p>

<p>When the man rested from the belabouring, Hugh asked to be allowed to
"try the dogs."</p>

<p>The fellow glared angrily at him; but then, with a surly nod, gave the
permission. Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> started with the leaders, and worked down the whole
line, placing the dogs in order once again, hauling them about, but
saying nothing. Then he took the gee-pole, and ordered "mush." The
leader looked back over his shoulder, as did the dog next him. "Mush!"
again cried Hugh. The dogs drew steadily at their collars, glancing
furtively at their new master. Hugh once more encouraged them, and when
the load began to move passed on his charge to the owner, who had the
grace to look sheepish.</p>

<p>"To handle dogs," said Hugh, when he had rejoined his party and had
resumed the trail, "you've got to get them frightened of you; and moving
round them, silent-like, puts fear in their souls. You see, that fellow
wasn't really hurting them; they could hardly feel that light whip
through their fur, and their feet and noses, where they are tender, they
stuck in the snow. As for howling&mdash;it comes natural to malamoots.
No&mdash;you've got to treat them just as you do women."</p>

<p>The trail often became precipitous, but as the combined strength of the
three men and the dogs was sufficient to lift the load bodily, their
difficulties were well overcome.</p>

<p>They had not been out of the White Pass City an hour when George shouted
"Look!" and pointed to the mountain-side to the left. The trail away
above them was lined with horses, moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> slowly forward; but down the
mountain-side eight burroes were plunging&mdash;head tied to tail as is the
custom. Every dog team on the lower trail had stopped to watch the
sight, for there was a great rattling of rock and a general shout
calling attention to the catastrophe. The unfortunate creatures soon
reached the base of the slide and were lost in the soft snow. They
struggled, and they disappeared. One more sacrifice to that dreadful
trail, which, during the Klondike rush, had claimed the lives of
thirty-five hundred animals! In that canyon, between White Pass City and
the summit, during the spring of 1898, it was possible to walk long
distances on the bodies of dead horses, and to this day the line of
march is marked by protruding bones, indicating the graves of the
patient and faithful creatures, sacrificed to man's insatiable greed for
gold.</p>

<p>"Now you see where the dog-food comes from," remarked Hugh.</p>

<p>The accident had occurred a little in front of them, and shortly
afterwards two men were seen floundering through the soft snow down the
side hill to the beaten trail, along which the dog-teams were pressing.</p>

<p>"You had hard luck," Hugh called to them.</p>

<p>"Yes, I couldn't keep that blame bell burro from experimenting how near
he could go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> side without falling off, till at last he got his
needings," replied one of the drivers.</p>

<p>"Whose outfit were they?"</p>

<p>"Rivers; and the Canadian Government owns the supplies&mdash;police stuff.
They can stand it."</p>

<p>The two drivers went on down the trail to White Pass City.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government was evidently not popular. The iniquities of the
royalty on gold, and the grafting current in the Gold Commissioner's
office in Dawson were resented.</p>

<p>As the party progressed up the Pass, they found its walls coming closer
together, making the canyon so narrow that the horse trail on the
mountain-side appeared directly overhead. Numbers of dead cattle
appeared by the side of the path, telling of the calamities of the
trail. Veterans of the trail will tell weird tales of horses, goaded by
whip and burden, deliberately throwing themselves into the canyon
below&mdash;seeking surcease from suffering in death. As the canyon became
narrower, so did the trail become more congested. It also grew steeper
as they neared the summit, and men and dogs had frequently to pause for
rest. It appeared to John a curious struggling mass that surrounded him,
strange oaths in all accents came to his ears. The multitude were
striving in a race in which brute force alone could conquer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>They came to a party in trouble, and overheard an argument.</p>

<p>"I tell you the territory clear through to Lake Bennett belongs to the
United States, and I'm convoy for the United States Customs. I ain't
going to let you get over the summit until you pay my wages for four
days more, that is, two days from the summit to Lake Bennett loaded, and
two days back again from Bennett to Skagway, travelling light, and
that's going some too. It amounts to thirty-two dollars, at eight
dollars per day&mdash;so all you've got to do is pay up."</p>

<p>"No, you don't own the land beyond the summit. Don't you see the English
flag up there&mdash;that red thing flying from the tent pole? All you've got
to do is show me over the summit, and we're quits. I've paid you forty
dollars already: three days doing nothing at White Pass City during the
storm; and you lost the money playing Black Jack. I ain't got any more
money to pay you, anyway. I can't pay you when I ain't got the money."</p>

<p>"Well, dig for it; sell part of your outfit. You can't bluff me. I'm an
officer of the United States Customs, and I'm on to my job."</p>

<p>"More grafting," muttered Hugh.</p>

<p>So it was that these convoys, armed with authority more or less real,
harassed and blackmailed the victims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>They were now near the summit, in the midst of the last struggle which
would put them over the most difficult portion of the trail, and the
excitement was general. There was a deal of shouting, and a great
renewal of effort. The horse trail and the lower trail merged into one.</p>

<p>At last they were through. The narrow defile curved to the right; an
open basin appeared, with strewn tents and an endless promise of
supplies; and&mdash;most conspicuous of all!&mdash;side by side the flags of
Britain and the United States were flying.</p>

<p>A dozen members of the Canadian Mounted Police, wearing the uniform of
England's Queen, were examining freight, with their backs to the wind,
or passing in and out of a tent, half buried in snow, which served as an
office. This was the second great depot out from Skagway, and piled
about everywhere were loads of freight. Outfits stood about in disorder,
awaiting the returning tide of men, while constantly teams were arriving
from, or setting out to, Bennett.</p>

<p>The outfit of Hugh and his companions was finally passed by eleven
o'clock. Goods of Canadian manufacture were allowed to pass free, and
the charges against the few American goods were of no great amount. Hugh
selected a projecting rock on which to make his cache, and the policeman
who examined his baggage, and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> good offices the party had won,
promised to keep an eye on their goods.</p>

<p>"Soapy doesn't operate on this side," said the man in uniform
significantly.</p>

<p>"We could coast back in half an hour if the trail was clear," Hugh
remarked, as they started on the return.</p>

<p>As it was, they sat on the sleigh most of the way to White Pass City,
which they reached at noon&mdash;as a man was pounding a great triangle of
steel with an iron rod, announcing dinner.</p>

<p>The three were very well pleased with their morning's work.</p>

<p>There were not quite so many teams on the trail in the afternoon, and
they reached the summit by half-past three. The sun had been shining all
day, so that the atmosphere seemed mellower; and the wind did not blow
so strongly. After passing the goods they had time to climb the ridge on
which the police tents were erected. From thence they gazed down the
valley, which they knew was the uppermost watershed of the mighty Yukon,
whose course makes a great curve of twenty-four hundred miles ere it
flows into the Behring Sea. Far in the distance they could see a stunted
growth of timber, but their immediate surroundings were mountains,
hardly less overpowering than in White Pass City.</p>

<p>The view impressed them&mdash;the scene was weird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> in its desolation; they
felt that stirring incidents were to take place in that great valley
before them.</p>

<p>"Looks as if we would have a touch of spring to-morrow, and I guess we
had better have our snow-glasses ready before we set out," said Hugh.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;"/><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>OVER THE SUMMIT</h3>


<p>Hugh's prediction came true, for, on the morning following, a gentle
breeze was blowing from the south, soft with the touch of spring. The
first light that came over the mountains was a softening blue.</p>

<p>"Roll out and get the kinks out of you, fellows, we've got to be first
on the trail to-day."</p>

<p>They had breakfast, the dogs were harnessed, and the party on the march
by half-past four. Though the light was uncertain it was not hard to
keep the trail. By six they were at the summit, greeting the police
sentinel who had been on guard there through the night, and marvelling
at the wealth of colours that lit the eastern sky.</p>

<p>"Mush!"</p>

<p>The dogs were off. The sleigh slid down upon the frozen plain of Summit
Lake. The lightness with which it glided along seemed to assure the
party that their troubles were over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> As the dogs trotted along it
required a pace faster than a walk to keep up with them; so Hugh induced
his two companions to sit on the load, saying that he would take a ride
after a while. At nine they reached Log Cabin&mdash;passed without a halt, it
being merely a police depot used for cutting firewood, though it had
been the Customs post before the Canadian Government had asserted
proprietary rights to the summit. Almost invariably, when greetings were
exchanged with those met on the trail, the humour played about Soapy.</p>

<p>"Say, you're hustling. I guess you ain't chechachoes. How's Soapy? going
to run for President next trip?"</p>

<p>"I guess so, if he ain't hung in the meantime. Looks like that he was
the whole thing in the Passes."</p>

<p>As the party at one o'clock drew into Bennett, they saw one party eating
dinner in the open, with sleigh loaded and dogs harnessed beside them. A
pile of spruce boughs denoted where these strangers had slept, and where
their tent, now drawn up on their sleigh, had been erected.</p>

<p>"Moving camp?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you're going to take your location away with you?"</p>

<p>"I guess not."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it will just suit us, and we can use your fire. This is what I
call lucky," said Hugh, as he began unlashing the load and throwing the
bundles of supplies on the spruce bed.</p>

<p>George was busying himself undoing the supplies while John replenished
the fire. George cooked bacon; Hugh mixed flour, baking-powder, and
water for slap-jacks&mdash;the large pancakes of the frontier. As they worked
Hugh re-opened conversation with the strangers.</p>

<p>"Where's your new location?"</p>

<p>"Down the lake, five miles. Got wind of a good bunch of timber there,
and hauled a load down this morning. One of our fellows stayed down
making camp while us two came back for the rest of the stuff."</p>

<p>"How long have you been coming from Skagway?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks&mdash;a week here, and two weeks getting over the Pass.
Contracted with a fellow to put through our stuff at thirty cents a
pound, but finally had to buy dogs and haul it ourselves. And then the
storms have been something fearful up to the last few days: sort of
Dakota blizzard every day almost, after which trails was mighty bad
hauling. This sort of weather comes hard on a fellow who was reared in
California."</p>

<p>"I guess it would come hard on a fellow reared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> at the North Pole! You
fellows will have your boat built in lots of time."</p>

<p>"Yes, if we don't take to quarrelling like the rest of the blame fools
around here."</p>

<p>"What are those fellows doing here?" Hugh nodded to the great array of
tents spread over the sand hills that lie between Lake Bennett and Lake
Lindeman.</p>

<p>"Most of them don't know what they are doing; but I guess they put in
their time quarrelling. Old Moss-backs from the East, who have lived
neighbours all their lives, and been best of friends, have come up here
partners, and before they got through the Passes were calling each other
the names they heard used by the old-timers to their dogs! It takes the
police all their time settling disputes. The habit seems to have took
all round, now that they are through their troubles and have only
straight hard work, whip-sawing lumber, ahead of them. Why, say! I saw
two fellows the other day dividing their outfit. They took a two-faced
axe and drove it into a log, and with the face sticking up and a hammer
they cut a whip-saw in two, making it no good for either, and swearing
at each other all the time till you could smell sulphur. They cut stoves
in two, and boats, after working hard to build them. It seems a new kind
of bughouse that has got hold of them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The strangers were now washing up their dishes and packing them away.
"Here, take this, hand me a plate," and one of them poured some stewed
prunes out of a pot, and from another emptied into a second plate beans
and bacon.</p>

<p>"But you fellows could take these along!" protested Hugh.</p>

<p>"No, we couldn't; they'd get spilled; besides, we have some beef-steak
for supper. Some fellows down near the lake killed an ox this morning,
and you can get steak for six bits per pound&mdash;if it ain't all gone.
Good-bye!"</p>

<p>The strangers went off down the hill to the lake.</p>

<p>Pipes were lit, and the three lay in the sun smoking. The day was
glorious and the party had removed their snow-glasses, so that they were
able to view their surroundings to the full. Mountains gleamed and
glistened everywhere in the distance, but did not appear so overpowering
or inspiring as in the Pass, though more beautiful. How pure the air
seemed, and spotless the snow!</p>

<p>Though the sun was warm and the party comfortable, there were duties to
be performed; so, not without groans, Hugh and his friends started to
erect camp. After the tent was up, Hugh put pots of beans, prunes, and
rice on to boil&mdash;the rice being for the dogs, as there was small
prospect of getting dead horse in Bennett.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>After the bed had been made and the supplies stored in the tent, and
more wood cut, there was nothing to be done; so Hugh went off among the
tents on a "mooch round"&mdash;with an eye for beef-steak! George, acting as
cook, stayed at home.</p>

<p>John also went sight-seeing. He took a different trail from his friend,
crossed to the west side of the stream that led from Lake Lindeman to
Lake Bennett, and walked in the direction of a smoke stack, the local
saw-mill, half a mile distant.</p>

<p>As he strolled through the array of tents, he heard angry voices
proceeding from one of them.</p>

<p>"I tell you he's no good," one was shouting. "I had to pull most all the
way up the Chilkoot&mdash;him saying he had rheumatism, backache, toothache,
heartburn&mdash;everything but the mumps, for them I could see. An' then,
when we did get over the summit, it's me who had to do all the pulling."</p>

<p>"It's a lie&mdash;you're a low dog; and didn't I have to take whisky along
before you'd travel at all? I tell you, Mr. Policeman, he's no good,
he's a skunk, and I wouldn't take a skunk into Dawson with me, not if I
never got there, nor never saw the million dollar claim I guess I'm
going to get&mdash;if ever I get there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>John, passing beside the tent, could see the two disputants each seated
on a log of wood, with a red-coated policeman standing in front of them.</p>

<p>"Well," said the policeman, "if you fellows can't get on together, the
only thing to do is split up the outfit and each take what belongs to
him."</p>

<p>"I own the whole outfit," said the man with the many diseases.</p>

<p>"No, you don't; I own the tent, the stove, the sleigh, and a whole lot
of the grub," shouted the other.</p>

<p>John passed on. Another petty problem for the Mounted Police! They are
great men, great workers, those yellow-legs!</p>

<p>There were some industrious 'prentices at Lake Bennett, for down along
the shore were numerous groups of men, building boats.</p>

<p>"Like beef-steak?" asked Hugh, as John returned.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;rather."</p>

<p>A big frying-pan, with sizzling meat, was busy on the little tin camp
stove.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on the meat, John, while I get some water."</p>

<p>Hugh took a pail and went off to the river.</p>

<p>George Bruce was away with an axe getting wood, so John was left in
charge. Shortly afterwards George came along, hauling a log of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>wood
by an axe driven into it. John ran to assist him, and when the two had
returned with the wood Hugh was arriving with the water. John again
turned his attention to the frying-pan: the largest piece of steak was
gone!</p>

<p>"What has happened to the steak?" John asked.</p>

<p>Hugh looked. A grim smile came over his face.</p>

<p>"Dude!"</p>

<p>"Dude could not steal steak out of a frying-pan?"</p>

<p>"Not Dude? You bet your life that's where the steak has gone to. And
there is no use licking him; the only way to cure Dude of stealing is to
cut his tail off behind his ears. I told you Dude would rather steal
than eat: and this shows how careful you must be."</p>

<p>Dude was lying a picture of innocence on the snow. How he could maintain
an appearance of unconcern with a broiling hot beef-steak inside him was
a marvel! John looked at him amazed: the smallest slit of a black eye
was watching him.</p>

<p>"I was only away about three minutes."</p>

<p>"Half a minute is enough for Dude. He likes beef-steak!"</p>

<p>Hugh refilled the pan and then&mdash;civilization knows no artifice to better
the enjoyment of such a meal!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>They were partakers, too, of another repast&mdash;their souls were fed by the
glories of nature: the sun was setting; its splendour spread from high
in the heavens to the rugged range that yesterday had resisted them. On
that vast canvas were painted salmon-coloured clouds with long ribbons
of yellow, bearing the lustre of burnished gold.</p>

<p>It was the extreme of grandeur, awe-inspiring and ennobling. The evening
was very still.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>STORM AND STRESS</h3>


<p>It was five o'clock on the morrow before the party was up, and six
o'clock before, breakfast cooked and eaten, John and Hugh were on the
road to the summit. They were to travel the twenty miles there, and
return with one thousand pounds of supplies.</p>

<p>The glow of the sun was already upon the mountains when they set out.</p>

<p>"Say! it's going to be a hot day, and it's going to thaw some. It'll
make hauling easy, but our feet will be pretty wet; good thing we've got
some dry socks and rubbers in our outfit at the summit. Another thing
is, we're going to meet a whole lot of fellows on the trail the way
we're going to-day; and, what's worse, we'll get more of them coming
back."</p>

<p>Sure enough, after they left Log Cabin, they could see the toilers
coming, winding in a snake-like procession among the hills.</p>

<p>Hugh had prophesied correctly. By eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> o'clock they were in their
shirt-sleeves. The dazzling whiteness of the snow, reflected from all
sides, made the use of smoke-glasses necessary; but the perspiration,
dimming the glass, troubled their sight. The end of John's nose became
painful; his cheeks burned. It reminded him of the after-effects of his
first sunny spring day on the water in England.</p>

<p>They met and passed scores of teams, and still more were pouring over
the summit when they arrived there at one o'clock. It was half-past two
before they had their feet encased in German socks and rubber shoes, and
their load ready again for the trail.</p>

<p>"We can't make home before dark, but we should be able to make Log Cabin
by seven, after which the trail will be clear, and we should arrive by
ten. This trail will be mighty good going after it starts to freeze,
which it will do, soon as the sun goes down."</p>

<p>At four o'clock they were three miles on the trail. There was already
frost in the air.</p>

<p>Ere another half-hour had passed Hugh felt his cheek smitten by a gust
of wind, laden with particles of ice.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" he exclaimed; "these last few days have shown too large
a pay streak of spring to last. We're in for trouble. It will be down on
us in half an hour. All we can do is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> to keep on as we are going,
steadily. I guess we shall make Log Cabin, but not with this load. The
soft snow makes a thousand pounds too much for the dogs. Look!" He
pointed to a miniature cyclone coming along the trail, drinking up the
ice particles as it whirled. It struck them sharply as a gust of wind.</p>

<p>The first contact of the storm was cold and cutting; then the wind
veered, and down came the snow. The sleigh was soon too heavy.</p>

<p>"The only thing is to cache the sleigh and turn the dogs loose; the
chances are we won't be able to keep the trail in this storm; and if we
do come out alive, we won't be able to find the sleigh if we abandon it
far from the trail."</p>

<p>"Do you think the storm will be very bad?"</p>

<p>"It's bad now, ain't it? How long will it be before there is eighteen
inches of snow on this trail? For a time we can keep it by feeling it
hard under us; but we are liable to get off it&mdash;and once lost, there is
no finding it again. Mind, the wind is blowing from the right, half to
the rear. Here's a tree; I've noticed this lone spruce before, and we
can find it again. Let us stand the sleigh up against it, and turn the
dogs loose."</p>

<p>So to the tree dogs and men struggled; the dogs were unhitched, harness
was piled on top of the load. Then, with a great effort, the men managed
to up-end the load against the tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh called Dude to him, and pulled an old envelope out of his pocket,
on which he scratched: "Cached sleigh on north side of trail by spruce
tree, five miles from the summit.&mdash;Hugh Spencer." This he tied to a
handkerchief, and that to Dude's collar.</p>

<p>"It's no harm letting George know where the grub is, for if we don't
find camp again, Dude will."</p>

<p>The dogs went, Dude leading, and were soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>Down the trail the two men strode. The snow was six inches deep already,
the wind piling it upon the trail. The weather did not feel cold; in
fact, both were comfortably warm. For an hour they plodded along.
Occasionally one would plunge into the soft snow and scramble back on to
the beaten trail. Conversation was not much indulged in.</p>

<p>The light began to fail, yet they stumbled along. There was nothing they
could recognize in the boulders and cliffs that loomed around them in a
deathly monotony.</p>

<p>For half an hour darkness was upon them, when Hugh remarked that Log
Cabin could not be far away. Immediately following his remark they
plunged into soft snow. The trail seemed to have come to an end; but
this could not be so. They retraced their steps and regained firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
footing. They felt cautiously around with their feet, but could find the
underlying snow hard only in the direction whence they came.</p>

<p>"I guess we're off the trail, and have walked along a bank where the
wind has packed the old snow good and hard. Looks to me as if we was
lost."</p>

<p>"Don't give up," said John.</p>

<p>"Give up! I ain't giving up; but we're lost. I won't give up as long as
I can wiggle."</p>

<p>"What had we better do?"</p>

<p>"Keep moving! If you don't, you freeze!" Spencer's voice was low and
serious as he said, "Keep the wind on your right side; and if you've got
any last will and testament to make, scratch it on a piece of paper and
leave it in your pocket before your hands get numb, or your mind weak.
We're up against it hard! We will stay together, of course; but should
we get separated, don't move too fast, or you will tire yourself out and
go to sleep in the snow. Don't let sleep take hold of you, or you're
dead! Just keep moving fast enough to keep warm, or, at least, from
freezing; go down hill rather than up; and don't fall over a cliff. Have
you ever been up against a life-and-death proposition? If not, you are
pretty near one now."</p>

<p>They proceeded on their uncertain journey, but were soon floundering in
soft snow. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> kept on. It was easy enough to say "keep going
down-hill," but, so far as John was concerned, he seemed to be walking
up-hill all the time. They frequently exchanged shouts, and so remained
together.</p>

<p>For hours they plodded on, the snowfall growing less, but the cold
greater.</p>

<p>John began to act, to call, mechanically. His mind in that desolate
trampling was transported to happier places. He thought of his Alice
Peel. She was probably, he mused, thinking of him also. Did her mind
ever picture such experiences as he was now realizing? She would
possibly read in the newspapers of the great rush of gold-seekers over
those terrible mountains and through the stormy passes. If he should die
in that storm, and months afterwards she heard of his demise?... The
thought drifted along to several loose ends. He must not sleep, or he
would die; and it was his duty to live; but&mdash;oh! to sleep!... His
father, and the old school, the church services! How much he would like
to hear the old organ and the choir!... It had been the family wish that
he should take Holy Orders, and he had refused the vocation, feeling it
not his. Had he done right? He believed yes.... He might be about to
meet his Creator. What might his record be?...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>His mind went back to an occasion in Australia, when he had been lost in
the Bush, and had wandered for days without water, till some blacks
found him. He remembered, before going into unconsciousness with his
back against a rock, that a vulture was watching him. He had taken a
piece of stone, and, pretending it was a pistol, had pointed it at the
bird....</p>

<p>John Berwick's mind was picturing sand and heat, while above him roared
the Arctic storm.</p>

<p>How cold it was getting, and the wind was beginning to blow! The parka
did not sufficiently protect his face.</p>

<p>Hugh shouted out that they were crossing a lake, and there might be a
camp along its edge. They came in due course to the other side of the
lake, with the cliff so steep they could not climb it. They followed the
shore to the right, facing the storm. They crossed another lake, and
still another. The air had grown intensely cold; the wind was higher,
and ever there came that terrible inclination to lie down and sleep.</p>

<p>After they had passed over the last little lake Hugh shouted to John
that they were surely now far from the proper trail, as he could
recollect no such water near Bennett. Lake Lindeman was four miles long.</p>

<p>The wind was rising, and the increasing cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> told that it came from the
north. Hugh began now really to doubt whether they would live through
the storm.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards fine ice crystals impinged against their faces. Great
swirls of wind fell upon them. This new severe onslaught of nature
aroused John, who called to his comrade. He had suddenly realized how
very, very close they were to death.</p>

<p>"The snow is going&mdash;it's easier walking," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>They closed together, and struggled along abreast. They were too nearly
dead to notice that the going was good. Suddenly John fell into the soft
snow, and Hugh, exerting his worn powers, dragged him back.</p>

<p>"The trail, the trail," gasped John, with his face close to Hugh's.</p>

<p>"Trail! we ain't been on any trail for hours."</p>

<p>"Feel with your feet!"</p>

<p>Hugh stopped to feel with his feet two runner tracks of horse sled. Hope
came to them, made a great call to their resources. Meanwhile their
tired hearts and very weary bodies endured the bombardment of the
snow-laden wind, which seemed to penetrate them, taking the heat of life
from their vitals!</p>

<p>They came to another lake. How the wind cut! The snow, driven over the
surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> ice, gave a hard, grinding noise. Would ever they come
to the end of that pitiless journey!</p>

<p>Bang! They stumbled against a sleigh standing in the middle of the road.
Hugh kicked at it; the singletree rattled; he recognized the sound. He
gave a desperate shout; another and another.</p>

<p>Then, at last, the promise of relief and of life came to them. They
smelt smoke. Just for a second!&mdash;that creosotic odour was to them as
sweetest perfume. It meant life, warmth, comfort, human companionship.</p>

<p>The figure of a man with a lantern loomed up before them, and a deep
voice asked,</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"We're lost," said John.</p>

<p>"No, you're not; you're right here on Crater Lake, just over the summit
of the Chilkoot."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said Hugh.</p>

<p>"We're the police; come inside." They staggered into a tent warmed by a
tin stove, on which was a pot of coffee. The man quickly produced cups,
and gave them to drink.</p>

<p>John Berwick just fell on a pile of wood, stacked near the stove, and
fell asleep. Now that the great struggle against the elements, which
force of personality rather than strength of limbs had carried him
through, was over, he collapsed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>When the policeman returned with bread and meat for them, he found Hugh
removing his friend's shoes, and brushing the snow from his legs.</p>

<p>"Let him sleep," said Hugh.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In far-away London at that very hour&mdash;in England high noon&mdash;Alice Peel
was walking down Regent Street. Her spirits were restless. The bustling
traffic, the interest of the shops, the passing of the people, could not
keep her thought from a far wanderer. She was weary of this ordered
civilization; and remembering John in his adventures heard the call of
the wilds.</p>

<p>There was now a possibility for this yearning to be satisfied. Her
father, Surgeon-Major Peel, had lost his money through a sudden
misfortune, and had been prompted by the news from the Klondike also to
make a bid for fortune there, not as a gold-seeker, but in his own
profession. He was convinced that a hospital in that desperate region
would be in all ways a good venture.</p>

<p>Alice had determined to accompany him. To her that spring morning, even
with all the fever of restlessness in her blood, was full of hope. The
soft air and the sunshine were conditions&mdash;how different from those
endured by Berwick and his comrade in their life-and-death march!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>AN EMPIRE'S OUTPOST</h3>


<p>After two hours of solid sleep, the blanket was lifted from the
exhausted gold-seekers, and they were shaken back into life.</p>

<p>"Get up and eat, you need it."</p>

<p>Still aching in every bone the two poor fellows staggered to their feet.</p>

<p>A dim light was penetrating the canvas, as they looked about them.
Underneath was ice&mdash;the frozen surface of Crater Lake&mdash;on which were
spread piles of blankets, the beds of the police.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fire, the air of the tent was chill and frosty, and
the canvas flapped in the wind. The walls of the tent were dark, showing
the level of the snow around them. The presence of this snow, no doubt,
explained how the tent had withstood the fury of the gale.</p>

<p>The policeman led the way to the cook tent, where they were given bacon
and slap-jacks.</p>

<p>"Can't make bread here, and don't get it very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> often from Dyea, and
we're just out now," apologized the policeman who acted as cook.</p>

<p>While they were eating ravenously, the officer in command of the post
called to see them and inquired if they were any the worse for their
experiences.</p>

<p>"Hardly salubrious, the climate, eh?" he said, after they had answered
his particular questions. "On several occasions we have had the tents
blown down, and frequently the men had to sit up all night holding the
poles to prevent a catastrophe. I must say our fellows have shown great
grit under most trying circumstances. You see we are on a civil campaign
here, and there is not the excitement of fighting to keep the men up."</p>

<p>With that the officer left the tent. A policeman glanced after him and
muttered,</p>

<p>"Civil campaign! Hear the old man talk! We're holding down the blooming
Passes for the Queen! That's what we're doing. We could live in comfort
at Lindeman, with all the wood we want for cabins and to burn."</p>

<p>"Where do you get your wood?"</p>

<p>"Down the trail&mdash;when we get any at all. They send a horse up from
Lindeman. The last few days the trail has been pretty good, and some
teams have been hauling from there to here: but we got only one
load&mdash;which won't last us through the storm, if it holds much longer."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you collect much duty here?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;rather! The old man just dumps the money he takes in a leather
sack, and the other day he had thirty-five thousand dollars in it; but
he hasn't got that much now. He sent one of the fellows down to Skagway
with it. It was rather risky, for all the hard cases travelling the
Passes got to know the sack; and there was a good deal of risk of the
fellow getting shot; but he went through the whole gang and got on the
boat at Dyea, and crossed to Skagway."</p>

<p>"The man had pluck!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but human nature in many ways is alike in both red-skin and white
men, and the police have learned to do these sort of things. Down on the
plains in the old days, when the savages were mean, it was often the
case that one or two policemen would ride into a reservation, arrest a
red-skin, and take him away with hundreds of armed Indians yelling
around them. The Indians thought the police were crazy, and it is
against their religion to kill a crazy man. I guess if Soapy recognized
the sack he thought it was a job of some kind."</p>

<p>"Do as many men come over this Pass as over the White Pass?"</p>

<p>"More! The Chilkoot is the poor man's Pass. Most of the fellows who come
over here haul their own stuff, and pack it over the summit, or hire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the Siwashes to put it to the summit, and haul from here themselves.
They get it up here, and then, when they get a fine day, run it through
to Lindeman or Bennett, where they build their boats. An outfit is
putting in an aerial tram: that is, a cable from the foot of the big
hill to the top."</p>

<p>"This summit is too steep for horses?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. It's as much as an ordinary man wants to climb it light, and
it's much worse with a pack on your back, though a Siwash staggered up
the other day with a cask of tar weighing three hundred and fifty
pounds. The sad part of it was that then he could not get his five
cents, a pound for his work!&mdash;at least he came to one of our fellows,
who told him to hide the barrel in the snow and not show the owner where
it was, till he got his money. Wait till you see the hill! It is one of
the most remarkable sights, I fancy, ever seen in the world's history:
thousands of men toiling in line up nine hundred feet of almost
perpendicular ascent&mdash;for what?&mdash;to be given a chance of drowning
themselves in the Yukon, or of dying of disease in the Dawson country!"</p>

<p>The time came for the evening meal; but the storm still raged outside
and the weather remained cold. It would be hard to conceive more
miserable surroundings! The heat given out by the stove was scarcely
felt six feet away, and the icy floor, snow walls, and flimsy roof
sapped the body's heat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> Darkness came, and bed-time. Two policemen
offered to share their bed with the guests, so that the strangers had
somewhere to lay their heads.</p>

<p>It appeared to John that he had just fallen to sleep when he was
awakened by the sentry calling to all hands to dress, as water was
overflowing the ice and coming into the tent. So up all hands got,
hastily dressing in the frosty atmosphere. By the uncertain light of a
few flickering candles water was to be seen entering the tent; and what
was the best move was a matter of discussion, till one policeman
suggested that sleighs be hauled into the tent, and the beds built on
them. This was done, but not before a good portion of the bedding had
become wet.</p>

<p>Let any one who desires a picture of the hardships which policemen and
civilians went through in those dreadful Passes imagine the poor fellows
living in tents, with water six inches deep within, a storm surging
without&mdash;and the thermometer many degrees below freezing-point! It was
three more days ere the wind ceased to blow, and for those three days
the police and their guests existed under distressing conditions. At the
end of the three days milder weather came; but the water still remained
on the ice, so that it was plain the camp must be moved. Preparations
were being made to do this when John and Hugh bade their kindly hosts
good-bye.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>ANOTHER PASS</h3>


<p>John and Hugh could not resist the temptation of looking at the
far-famed Chilkoot Pass ere they turned for the last time from the Great
Divide. So they mounted the steep ascent from Crater Lake to the summit.
Reaching this, they found a great array of caches, or drifts of snow,
the formation of which suggested a cache beneath them. A half-dozen
policemen were levelling the new site for their tents.</p>

<p>"A desperate situation for an encampment!" said John; but there was no
other.</p>

<p>Looking down the Pass it presented a picture like nothing so much as a
great funnel, with the side towards the sea broken out. Through this
passage from the sea a long line of ant-like figures, human beings, each
laden with his load, was pouring towards them.</p>

<p>The town of Lindeman was reached at three o'clock; at five they arrived
at Bennett. Dude rose up from his bed on the snow and looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> them;
but the four other dogs were bundles of fur before the camp, refusing to
give even a silent welcome.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Bruce, "here you are at last; I knew you would turn up
safe and sound, so stayed home to have something hot ready."</p>

<p>The two were ready for another meal; and as George had set up the camp
stove in the tent they were comfortable.</p>

<p>As soon as his partners had started on the morning of the storm, George
had set to work and put up the stove in the tent, and for the balance of
the day, till the storm came, had been cutting firewood&mdash;with no other
idea than to keep busy. And great was his reward! for he had enough to
do and to think of to keep him supplied during the storm and the severe
weather that followed. Then, at seven or eight o'clock, after the snow
had been falling several hours, a low wail came from outside the tent
door. Dude!</p>

<p>"You got the note on Dude's collar?" inquired Hugh.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I didn't go after the grub, being too anxious about you."</p>

<p>"That was right. The chechachoes will have the trail beaten for us
to-morrow. I only sent it in case we did not turn up, which we came
pretty near not doing! How have your neighbours been getting on: doing
much quarrelling?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; they have had too much trouble keeping warm, and have limited their
disputes as to who should go out into the storm and cut wood. They
weren't as lucky as I in having a good supply at hand."</p>

<p>How the wanderers appreciated their warm bed under the lynx-skin robe
that night! for in their late abode the chill of the ice and water had
seemed to penetrate to their bones!</p>

<p>The next day Hugh took a piece of canvas, and with a needle fashioned a
sail, after which he fixed a mast in the front of the sleigh and set the
sail.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "when spring sets in the wind generally blows
from the south, and we might as well make it work for us."</p>

<p>As it did when they started on the morning following. A breeze from the
south filled the sail and helped the sleigh over the frozen surface of
Lake Bennett.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock, and as they were close upon the end of March the
days were lengthening wonderfully, so that they had not been an hour on
the trail when daylight came.</p>

<p>As the light increased so did the wind, which relieved the dogs of
almost all the weight of the load. The trail was good, and by eleven
o'clock they had travelled the twenty miles to Caribou Crossing, the
site of the present town of Car-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>Cross. Here Hugh called a halt,
declaring they had done a good day's work, and that the
recently-abandoned camping-ground at which they then were was too good
to pass. So the dogs were unhitched, and their evening meal put to boil.
While this was in process the tent was erected and the bed made.</p>

<p>The second day out from Lake Bennett was much like the first; and so it
was until the fourth day, when they reached Miles Canyon and the White
Horse rapids. From Lake Bennett they passed Windy Arm to Tagish Lake;
and on Marsh Lake, which followed, they got more away from the
mountains, when their range of vision became greater.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the foot of Marsh Lake, which merged into Miles
Canyon, they found a number of men putting in a tramway, over which
horses would haul freight when navigation opened, thus covering the five
miles and avoiding the danger of the canyon and the rapids.</p>

<p>They hauled their load along the route of the tramway to below the
rapids, where the waters of the Yukon are known as the Fifty Mile River.
Here they found a number of men building boats, but they kept steadily
on.</p>

<p>Below White Horse Rapids fewer men were on the trail. Some they met were
travelling south, gaunt and haggard, unshaven, uncouth, loud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> voice
and wild of eye. These men had travelled the long trail from
Dawson&mdash;five hundred miles it was; and the heavy toil and hard food had
told on their minds and natures.</p>

<p>The party covered the fifteen miles from White Horse to where the Fifty
Mile enters Lake Le Berge, when the crust had become so soft that they
could not travel, so they camped. Recently the trail had taken on new
conditions, that of standing higher than the snow on either hand, like
the back of a great serpent. The fact was that the general level of snow
was settling under the warmth of the sun, while the trail, being packed
hard, remained as it was.</p>

<p>The tent was up and the bed made by noon. Hugh planned that the party
should go to bed at three, and "hit the trail" again at midnight. There
would be no wind to aid them further, for, as they left the coast range,
the diurnal breeze had failed. Their own efforts, and those of the dogs,
must haul the load the final stage of thirty miles to the foot of Lake
Le Berge, where they were to build their boat.</p>

<p>They ate their dinner and spread spruce boughs, over which they placed
their blankets, and enjoyed a rest in the glorious sunlight.</p>

<p>The view from the tent was beautiful. To the north lay the stretch of
the lake, on either hand of which were great rounded hills&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
dazzling white. To the south, far distant, were heavy ranges of
mountains. The air was that of peace and hope, and seemed full of
promise of the glorious summer soon to burst over this vastness of
solitude, melting the snows, and flooding the hillsides with floral
beauty.</p>

<p>Presently they saw two black specks crossing the frozen lake far
beneath, which eventually proved to be two human figures
approaching&mdash;one some distance behind the other. The first was hauling a
sled, slowly, and evidently with difficulty. Hugh at once acted. He put
the kettle to boil, and filled a frying-pan with beans and bacon.</p>

<p>"I guess those fellows coming up the lake will need a little grub when
they get here," he explained; "at least they can drink tea, if they are
too plumb played out to eat."</p>

<p>The actions of the leading man were very erratic. Frequently he would
stop, place his hand before his eyes, and when again he endeavoured to
start would stagger, plunging into the softened snow, which broke under
him, bringing him to the knees.</p>

<p>"Snow-blind," was Hugh's comment.</p>

<p>The stranger seemed to smell the smoke from the camp fire, and gave a
wild "Hullo!" The three answered the call. He turned towards the sound,
and when he saw the camp he shook him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>self free of the harness and
plunged through the soft snow towards it. When he saw the blankets
stretched before the tent he threw himself on them at full length, and
with his fingers at his eye-sockets groaned.</p>

<p>Sympathy being often better expressed by doing nothing, the man was left
in his misery for some ten minutes. Hugh then poured him out a cup of
tea, to which was added much sugar and condensed milk. The man raised
his head at a word, and showed his blackened face, made horrible by the
streaks of tears and perspiration. He drank the refreshment greedily.
Hugh explained the man's curious appearance.</p>

<p>"This fellow has been taking a leaf out of the Siwash's book in
blackening his face. The black saves the eyes a whole lot from the glare
of the sun."</p>

<p>The campers turned their attention to the second traveller, now plainly
in sight, and noticed that the pack on his back jolted him horribly, as
he broke through the trail at every third or fourth step. As he wore
glasses, he was evidently not in distress from his eyes. He saw the
camp, staggered to it, and threw himself down, pack and all, sitting
with his back against the load. He stared at the man in agony on the
blankets.</p>

<p>"Hello! there's Bill! Ha! I told the blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> fool not to travel without
glasses. Wake up, Bill, and tell us your dreams. How's that wife you're
so struck on outside, and you in such a hurry to give your dust to! Ho!
Bill, wake up!"</p>

<p>As the prostrate man gave no sign of hearing, his hilarious companion
turned to the others, and in more moderate tones continued,</p>

<p>"Bill and me have come from Dawson together, and he has near killed
himself&mdash;me, too&mdash;trying to get out and see his wife and kids; and this
morning nothing would do him but he must go and tramp on his glasses,
and bust them. I told him to lay up to-day and travel to-night, but he
wouldn't. Must keep moving to get to his wife. Ha! Wife be damned! I
ain't got no wife."</p>

<p>Hugh interrupted the tirade.</p>

<p>"Have some beans?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Beans&mdash;yes; nothing like beans on the trail; besides, I
don't mind eating your beans, seeing my own grub pile is most petered
out. Just a little flour and baking-powder left; not much good to travel
on."</p>

<p>The man fell to eating. His manner turned from hilarity to morosity. He
bolted his food. Soon his companion on the blankets moved, and gasped,
"Don't let that hog eat all the beans; I want some."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha! I thought Bill wasn't dead: you're just a bluffer, ain't you, Bill?
Say! Bill, let's turn round and go back to Dawson. We can travel along
with these fellows: they have lots of grub, and we can buy off them."</p>

<p>It was evident to John and his friends that&mdash;if the first stranger was
the worse affected in physical condition&mdash;the second was mentally the
more upset. The snow-blinded sufferer raised himself and took from Hugh
the plate of beans and a second cup of tea. This man ate slowly, while
his partner continued to talk.</p>

<p>"You see, me and Bill came from Dawson together; and when we got to
Thirty Mile we found it open, and the blame sleigh was always sliding
into the open water. I wanted Bill to chuck the sleigh and pack our grub
and blankets; but Bill wouldn't. So I says, 'I'll pack my half, and you
can haul your half,' and that's the way we've been coming. Bill had a
hell of a time with his sleigh sliding into the river; and then, coming
up the lake, he never could keep it on the trail. No wonder he's
bughouse!"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Crazy.</p></div>

<p>When the first arrival had finished his meal Hugh led him into the tent
and bathed his eyes with fresh-made tea. In the tent the sufferer was
free from the glare of the sun. Hugh hung a dark grey blanket from the
ridge pole, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> if the sufferer opened his eyes he could fix his
gaze upon it. Then he went out.</p>

<p>"How's Bill?" asked the erratic one.</p>

<p>"Better, I hope."</p>

<p>"Not bughouse yet?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Well, if he ain't bughouse, he is sure locoed on that wife of his."</p>

<p>Hugh made no reply, and the other continued,</p>

<p>"Ha! that's Bill Stanbridge; owns in on Eldorado with Slim Mulligan,
who's in charge now, and will look after the clean-up. My name is Frank
Miller; just blew in about the time Carmack made discovery, but went and
used my rights on Boulder Creek. Boulder showed up better on surface
than Bonanza or Eldorado, but there's nothing on bed-rock in Boulder."</p>

<p>As the man got his mind away from his partner, his conversation
indicated less disorder of intellect. Hugh, quickly noticing the change,
and with a view to further the good process, asked,</p>

<p>"How's Dawson?"</p>

<p>"Dawson! She's fine. Lots of grub. Old Healey gave the boys a speel last
fall that they'd all starve if they stayed in the country, and then the
speculators corralled all the grub and run up prices; but they're
loosening now. You can get a pretty good meal of beans now for two
dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> and a half&mdash;even at Miss Mulrooney's. Say! that girl is making
money."</p>

<p>"How's Bonanza?"</p>

<p>"Good; but Eldorado is better. Bill's go ground, some of it going five
hundred dollars to the pan for picked dirt. But this high grade pay! The
Government is going to send their yellow-legs round to relieve the boys
of ten per cent., and fellows with poor ground will have to pay as well
as the fellows on Eldorado. That ain't fair!"</p>

<p>"It's fair to charge for the administration of the country and keeping
law and order," said George.</p>

<p>"To hell with law and order! You're a chechacho, or you wouldn't talk
like that. Miners' meetings make pretty good law-courts; and now they
have law and order, fellows begin to lock their doors. The country was a
whole lot better before ever it saw an official."</p>

<p>"Yes; but the gang going in now will make things different," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"You're an old-timer?... Thought so when I first swallowed your beans.
Chechachoes don't know how to boil beans like that. You'll find a big
change round Rabbit Creek when you blow in there. It's gamblers and
saloon men most have the good claims. Of course Carmack had to put his
wife's relations in next to him on dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>covery; and when the crowd got up
from Forty Mile they staked on Boulder Gulch and Adams Gulch. Neither
any good&mdash;but say! they've got Dawson a hot town." He laughed. "Games
running night and day; all the fun you want, but no gun-play; the
yellow-legs will put you on the wood-pile right away quick, if ever you
make a break; and it ain't no fun to be sawing wood at forty below, with
a yellow-legs and a Winchester standing over you&mdash;for the glory of the
Queen of England!"</p>

<p>Frank Miller's mind was lapsing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A NEW PARTNER</h3>


<p>Frank Corte stood at the door of his kitchen and, with a large smile,
eyed the coming of the party. The new-comers were evidently going to
build their boat at the foot of Le Berge; and already he had favourably
sized them up.</p>

<p>There were many tents pitched around the cabin where Frank distributed
the necessities of human sustenance; but Dude's instincts drew him to
the kitchen, and down he and his canine followers flopped before the
door.</p>

<p>"Well! well! fine dogs, nice day, strangers. Going to build boat here?
yes, thought so. Thirty Mile is open to the Hootalink, and the Lewis is
getting holes in it. Early spring, sure!"</p>

<p>Frank's heart was hospitable; but the cost of grub was high: moreover,
the grub he cooked was not his. He was debating how far his hospitality
could go.</p>

<p>Frank Corte was a Hungarian by birth, and a citizen of the United States
of America, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> he proudly announced as opportunity offered. He was
over six feet tall, with long arms, stooping shoulders, and an angular
form. His physical strength was enormous: there was a wealth of native
kindness in his heart. His chief diversion was argument, in
which&mdash;thanks to his study of the Bible, and a small, besmeared
pocket-edition of Webster's Dictionary&mdash;he was rather effective. He
could argue with any one; or even on necessity address his convictions
to the little red-haired female dog that was ever at his heels. Frank
thought the world of Fanny.</p>

<p>"Say! fellows, it's against orders to feed pilgrims, though I guess you
ain't altogether tenderfeet; but if you wants to boil your tea and cook
grub on my stove, you're welcome. Come right in and cook up."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Hugh, "though I guess I will leave the team here and
mooch round and get a good camping-place. I guess we'll be here three
weeks, and might as well set up our tent in a good place. We're not
hungry."</p>

<p>"That's right; and you can't have a better camping-ground than right
over against that bunch of spruce." Frank was interested in these
strangers, and his desire for news stimulated his hospitality; so he
continued, "Come right in and feed up, and look for your camping-ground
after. Days are getting long now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh hesitated, and then accepted. Frank put on more wood, to which the
tin stove quickly responded.</p>

<p>"How's Soapy?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Fine," replied Hugh, "hold-ups galore. The people of Skagway have a
murder nearly every morning for breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Say! what a time Soapy would have if they only let him operate around
Dawson&mdash;wouldn't he make a killing! But them police! They don't have any
more excitement beyond the games and dance-halls in Dawson than they do
outside. That's no mining-camp for a country like this, and the crowd
what's inside there now. I don't like to see too much killing, but a
hold-up now and again is interesting!&mdash;besides, these rich claim-owners
can stand it. A fellow was telling me that it was nothing to see the
'Big Moose'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> coming into Dawson, last summer, with ten or twenty
thousand dollars tied to his saddle, and him without a guard! Say! we're
going to have a squaw-dance Friday night in the dining-room here, will
you come? One of our fellows has an accordion, and we'll have fine
music. Only four bits a dance. I'm going to try and get some hootch.
There's nothing like hootch to get the squaws on the move&mdash;if the
yellow-legs don't get on to it. They soak you like the devil if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
catch you at it, though. Say! how's Uncle Sam getting on licking them
there Spaniards?&mdash;he'll do them up in about three weeks. I'd like to be
outside to go to the Philippines. After he gets through with the
Spaniards he's going to come in and take Canada,"&mdash;and here Frank stole
side-glances at Hugh's companions; but his instincts of hospitality
stayed him from this, his favourite joke.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Indian name for the late Alexander McDonald.</p></div>

<p>"Say! where did you get those dogs? Fine team!"</p>

<p>"Three I got inside; the others in Skagway."</p>

<p>"I thought you was no chechacho. You come from Uncle Sam's country,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I come from all over: what's this outfit you're with?"</p>

<p>"Jack Haskins is building two scows to take down some freight he hauled
in over the ice. He has me cooking for him, though I could get $250.00
in Dawson for the same job. He only pays me $150.00 per month; but I'll
soon be in with the best of them. Say! if you fellows is going to build
a boat, I'll ask Jack if you can't use one of his pits. He has two, and
I guess you fellows can get the chance to use one of his pits for all
the lumber you want&mdash;and that will save you building one. I'm glad you
fellows have showed up&mdash;it will make more company&mdash;and I hope you'll
come to our dance. You'll see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> the squaw-camp down the river a bit.
They're out from Dalton House, came out to Tagish, visiting some
Siwashes there, and drifted down here, just to take in the sights! Are a
bit shy, though some have picked up a little English."</p>

<p>"Here is another human study," thought John, as he and his friends moved
over to the point suggested for their encampment. They found it
satisfactory, so went back for the dogs.</p>

<p>"Say! if you fellows want anything in the way of dishes, or if you're
real short of any grub, maybe I can let you have it on the sly," said
Frank to the party as they returned, his hospitality getting ahead of
his morals. But Hugh assured him the party was fixed up all right.</p>

<p>Frank's generosity was of the aggressive kind, for as John Berwick's
party sat in their tent that evening he stuck his head in at the door
and said they could have the use of one of Haskins' saw-pits on the
morrow, and probably right along.</p>

<p>"Don't work too hard, for I want you to be lively on Friday night! Two
fellows have just blown in from Dawson, and they say the river is full
of holes; so it is just as well you fellows don't have to build a pit;
it looks like an early opening, maybe about the first of May."</p>

<p>"The river won't open by the first of May, but it will before the tenth,
most likely," commented Hugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning the party visited the yard where the scows were building,
and introduced themselves to Mr. Haskins, who again informed them that
the saw-pits were at their disposal when he did not require them.</p>

<p>"Ever do any whip-sawing?" asked Haskins.</p>

<p>"Some," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"It's no picnic."</p>

<p>"I never found it so. How's timber? That looks pretty good up the hill
there," and Hugh pointed to a clump of spruce.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's all right; but you'll find bigger and clearer stuff higher
up, and you can mush it down the hill easy. I suppose you have your own
saw?"</p>

<p>With this the three friends stormed the hill. They were to cut the trees
and slide them to the bottom, after which the dogs would aid in hauling
them to the pit. The trees Hugh selected were the larger ones, clean and
free from knots. By the close of the day sufficient logs were at the
pit.</p>

<p>A saw "pit" is a scantling of poles eight feet high, on which the logs
are placed to be sawn. The <i>modus operandi</i> is that one man stands below
the log and another on the top: the upper man pulls the saw towards him,
the lower man co-operates. The work is simplicity itself, but very hard.
The three companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> would want from two to three hundred feet of
lumber, which meant perspiration and backache. As Hugh expressed it,
"the upper man is up against about the hardest proposition a white man
puts himself at, these days."</p>

<p>About three o'clock on the first afternoon of whip-sawing Frank Corte
appeared with Fanny at his heels. George was the upper man, and even his
elastic muscles were aching at the work. Hugh was having a spell off,
but keeping an eye on his friends.</p>

<p>"Ha! how do you fellows like hard work? This will teach you to go
hunting after gold! What have you done with your last summer's wages?
Say! we're going to have a great time at the dance&mdash;a regular potlatch:
one of the Sticks has just come in saying he's killed a caribou back on
the hills, and is going to potlatch it. Now if I can only get some
hootch! I'd give ten dollars a bottle for some."</p>

<p>"Better cut the hootch out," said Hugh. "The police may catch you and
send you down to Dawson; and put you sawing wood for Queen Victoria. And
it won't be Uncle Sam's men who will be chasing you with a Winchester."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. A damned pity Uncle Sam would not come over and take Canada:
then we should have a camp at Dawson."</p>

<p>George was very hot and sore; and this sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> of bantering was new to
him. He was in that humour which causes a man to go into a fight on
little provocation; but John, he noticed, was smiling amicably, so he
held his peace.</p>

<p>"If this was Uncle Sam's country, Soapy would have been here taking away
your wages before this," laughed Hugh.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't kick if he could do the trick. Say! can you dance? This is
going to be a swell dance all right! Wish I had enough lumber to cover
the floor, so we could dance proper. Poles is mighty hard to dance on.
Well, I must be going&mdash;I have some beans boiling. Don't you fellows tire
yourselves too much sawing lumber, so you can't dance to-morrow night."</p>

<h3>THE DANCE</h3>


<p>"Are you all set? Then dance! damn you, dance! Come on, gentlemen, get
partners for the next."</p>

<p>Frank Corte's great dance was on. Hugh and his companions stood by the
door of the dining-hall. On went the dance; and through the
atmosphere&mdash;thick with tobacco-smoke&mdash;the native women were guided,
their bronzed faces speaking excitement.</p>

<p>"Come on in, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>The walls of the room were lined with men. Squaws, who had not yet
learned the dance, sat on boxes. The three friends crowded into the room
and stood with their backs against the wall. Frank Corte was beating
time with his foot and clapping his hands, while he sang the calls in a
weird drawl.</p>

<p>"Honours to the right." Each man bowed most gravely to his partner, who
most respectfully returned it. "Honours to the left." Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> man bowed to
the lady at his left in the quadrille: and when "Swing your right-hand
lady; dance around the room" came, the men grabbed their partners and
whirled around&mdash;quarters were too close to permit of any great range of
movement, and the squaws were so excited, they seemed to occupy more
room than really they did.</p>

<p>"A la main left." All stood to attention. "First gent swing the
left-hand lady, with the left hand round."</p>

<p>Every gentleman turned towards the lady on his left. The ladies turned
to the right. They grasped left hands at the height of their shoulders,
and pranced round to the left.</p>

<p>"The left hand round.&mdash;Turn your partners, with the right hand,
round.&mdash;The right hand round.&mdash;All chassez!&mdash;First couple lead to the
right.&mdash;Four hand round.&mdash;Dos à balnette.&mdash;Right hand to partner, and
grand dos à balnette." Every man took his partner's right hand and
wheeled to the right; and then her left hand. This movement brought them
opposite, and so they were in a circle, at which they balanced, the men
facing outwards, the women inwards.</p>

<p>"On to the next!"</p>

<p>The men wheeled, and with their ladies pivoted to the left; then the men
took the hand of the ladies next on their right as they swung round. The
ladies holding the men by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> the left gave their right hand, and at the
words "dos à balnette," all again balanced&mdash;the men this time facing
inwards, the ladies outwards.</p>

<p>"On the next!"&mdash;again brought the men facing outwards, the ladies
inwards&mdash;and so on. The quadrille was concluded with,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Promenade all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seat your ladies at the ball."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The faces of the crowd were wild with excitement. The music was weird
and discordant. Yet John found it all very stimulating. Dance after
dance was gone through, while he stayed and watched, till there came to
his mind pictures of the old home&mdash;his father's house in London, and
Alice Peel! Was she thinking of him?</p>

<p>"Say! why don't you fellows get in and dance?"</p>

<p>Dreams and fancies were reft away as reality, in the person of Haskins
of the saw-pits, stood before John Berwick. Then he noticed George
laughing at a clumsy mystified squaw, a beginner in the dance. His
hilarity provoked the squaw, and, as the dance paused for a second,
between her gasps and through her perspiration she hissed with a look of
contempt,</p>

<p>"Che&mdash;chac. Ka!"</p>

<p>"Say! you fellows will have to get in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> dance in this next set. I saw
a squaw looking at you and saying 'heap dam dood,' so if you want to
keep your station in society you've got to dance." Haskins was again
worrying them.</p>

<p>"All right. Who will I ask to dance?" George was ready.</p>

<p>"Go and ask that squaw sitting in the corner," said Haskins, pointing
across the room. She it was who had said "Heap dam dood."</p>

<p>George went and invited her to be his partner.</p>

<p>"Ni&mdash;ka halo introdux" (You have not been introduced), she answered.</p>

<p>This was more than George could withstand in gravity. He roared with
laughter and returned to Haskins. He only guessed the meaning of the
words, so he repeated them to Haskins.</p>

<p>"Who the devil has taught these savages up here chinook! It's a special
lingo manufactured by the Hudson Bay Company to suit the savages, and
when white men first came into British Columbia they found the savages
with a lingo which was called white man's wa-wa, and which no person
could understand; it is easy enough to learn, you can pick it up in a
week; it has only about six hundred words. All the old-timers in British
Columbia talk it. Dagoes, Chinese, Mexicans, Swedes, all talked it in
the old days in Caribou. The Siwash calls an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> Englishman 'King George
man' and an American 'Boston man.'"</p>

<p>The squaw in the corner was keeping her eye on George with evident
dislike. As John noticed this he recommended their departure; so George
and he went back to bed. Hugh arrived home hours later in great glee.</p>

<p>"You fellows will laugh at the Siwashes, eh? Well&mdash;you'll get the worst
of it. George, I hear you were not sufficiently formal with one of the
klootches (squaws), and got called down&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning following John left Hugh and George repairing
their wardrobe in the tent, and was strolling past Frank Corte's kitchen
to where the scows were being built.</p>

<p>"Hullo! how's the 'heap dam dood'? Come in, I want to argue with you."</p>

<p>John looked up and saw the smiling face of Frank at his kitchen door. He
had no great wish to argue; but he loved the study of humanity, and
realized that Frank was something of a conundrum.</p>

<p>Corte, who was kneading bread, took a seat on a box by the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Say! don't you think it would be a good thing for this country if Uncle
Sam was really to come over and take it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope not. What's the matter with it as it is?"</p>

<p>"Too much police&mdash;too much law and order; you can never have a real live
mining-camp in Canada."</p>

<p>"That was a pretty good dance you had Friday night."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was all right; but what a time we would have had if we had had
lots of hootch! But say! that was a good one when the squaw told the
other 'King George man' he had not been introduced to her!"</p>

<p>Frank chuckled; and then, as the prospect of an international argument
did not seem good, went on another tack.</p>

<p>"Do you believe there is a God?"</p>

<p>A flood of memories surged through Berwick's brain.</p>

<p>He glanced at the dark sinister features of the man awaiting his reply
and then looked at the sunlight. Should he give such an answer in such a
tone as would discourage further argument? No&mdash;the question was too
serious. He might not have felt called upon at one time to divulge his
belief, which in the past had been a burden of much questioning; but
here it was asked, perhaps in levity, by one who evidently could not
fully believe. He felt called upon to answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>Corte's face had taken on a strained look. Realizing the seriousness
with which Berwick regarded the question, he feared lest he had hurt the
feelings of his guest. The answer he received reassured him. Removing
his big arms from the dough, and gesticulating, he answered,</p>

<p>"Well, partner, I don't. Now here's the proposition: those who say there
is a God say what He set out to do. The first thing God done was to
build the world; and after He done this He built a mighty fine ranch and
fixed it up A1; and then He puts Adam and Eve into it, after having made
them. He tells them not to eat apples&mdash;and then He goes and has a snake
which tells them to eat apples. And because they do eat apples He pulls
up the ranch and kicks them out. Now there would be no kick coming if He
simply turned them loose and made them rustle&mdash;having to rustle never
hurt any man&mdash;but He brings all sorts of diseases and pains on earth.
That's what keeps me from believing in God.</p>

<p>"Now look here; if God was able to make the earth, and the stars, and
everything, why should He not make man and let him enjoy all
this&mdash;seeing that He is doing it all more or less for amusement&mdash;without
putting him in the middle of a lot of good things and then putting up a
job on him? I've talked to parsons on this thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> and some of them says
that after He bust up the home ranch He kind of got sorry, and says He
would send His Son on earth to die&mdash;to fix up the big mistake Adam and
Eve made in eating one apple. Now, say! If you was doing all this, would
you, after you made man, and put him on the earth and he did wrong,
would you send your son to fix things up so that the crowd would go and
nail him to a big wooden cross by driving big stakes through his hands
and feet&mdash;and then stick him up for the crows to peck at? If God was not
able to make a man the first go off who would stand a mill-test, why did
He not kill him off, body and soul, and try again without trying to fix
things up by making His Son suffer? The whole proposition ain't natural.
And what would you think of a man who, if he fell down on any
proposition, would make his son go and suffer to fix up his mistakes?
Why did He not come on earth and die on the cross Himself, and suffer,
and turn the earth and all the stars and the rest of it over to His Son
to run while He was gone?"</p>

<p>John Berwick was not by nature argumentative, having seldom in his life
allowed himself to be drawn into any but political controversy. He had,
it is true, discussed doctrine at college with his class-mates. He had
read much philosophy, and had pondered deeply on the mystery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> human
suffering&mdash;the deepest of all mysteries. He had weighed the arguments of
great minds which wanted belief in God, and in his own mind had done
much to surmount the difficulty, to justify the ways of God to man; but
the crude intellect before him had launched forth a proposition he could
not confute. His training in rhetoric and in the drawing of parallels
was of use only against the cultured mind. The legend of the Saxon king
drawing the simile of life from the little bird which flew within the
hall firelight and was gone again came to his mind, but he put it aside
as impotent. He did not know what to say; he said nothing.</p>

<p>Frank Corte was working at his bread again, his face twitching with a
smile.</p>

<p>"And then there's miskities, and black flies, and moose flies, and
bull-dogs. Say! wait a month or two till the miskities get busy, and
then try and figure out how any great and good God would put such things
on earth! These devils ain't in cities where men is, but in the country
where the beasts is. Have you ever seen a big bull-moose going hell-bent
for election through the bush chased by flies? Have you ever shot a
bear, with his eyes and ears and nose full of flies, and the flies
sticking all round his eyes, enough to drive even a bear plumb crazy?
Why should God, because man went and eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> an apple, make animals suffer
in trying to get even?"</p>

<p>Frank Corte returned to the kneading, while John Berwick thoughtfully
watched the sun-flooded landscape.</p>

<p>"Frank," he said, after a pause, "'the proof of the pudding is the
eating.' I have never heard any argument quite like yours, but man's
coming to the world, how he came to the world, and whether he has a soul
have been the greatest subjects of study through the ages. We know the
Christian religion was taught back to within a few years of the time
Christ came on earth; and from that time on has got bigger in power and
influence over the minds of men, so that the majority of civilized
people give justice to their fellows because this religion tells them to
do so.</p>

<p>"The Bible tells a story of the origin of man, which we may or may not
believe. The Bible says there is a God; and God sees best not to explain
His schemes and why He makes man and animals suffer. I believe there is
a God, and that God is just, and that there is a reason for everything.
Why not try to believe there is a God, rather than argue with yourself
and others that there is no God? If the Christian belief has made the
world so much better as a whole, it will make you and me better as
single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> men; and I know you would give a man a meal if he wanted it; or
if a fellow were sick you would help him out all you could, and you'd
expect me to do the same. If you saw a fellow drowning in the river
you'd help him out; but the Chinaman, who is not a Christian, would let
him drown. You're a Christian all right; but you don't know it."</p>

<p>John paused, and would have added something; but Frank, his face half
flushed in confusion, his voice less rasping than usual, broke in,</p>

<p>"Say! stranger, when I first saw you I sized you up along with the
Siwashes as a 'heap dam dood,' though I didn't like to say it
serious-like; but that's a pretty good talk of yours, and, sure, sounds
natural. Say! is that other 'King George man' with you as good a fellow
as you are? Say! you've set me thinking!"</p>

<p>Frank had set Berwick thinking too.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>A LONG SHOT</h3>


<p>Hugh Spencer was working as upper man on the whip-saw, and an Indian was
trying to extract a cartridge from an old and rusty rifle at his camp
down the river. Suddenly there was a report, and Hugh tumbled headlong
from his position. His friends sprang to his side, and found blood
spurting from a hole in his neck.</p>

<p>The flow was not great, so that their first feeling of horror was
changed to hopefulness. John shouted and waved to Haskins, whom he saw
standing near his scows. Haskins came running up, was told what had
happened, and with the single word, "Wait!" bolted to his tent. He was
back again in little more than a minute, with a camp-bed, blankets and
all. Few words were spoken, and those in whispers. The injured man was
lifted on to the bed, and carried to the tent, his temporary home.</p>

<p>"George, hot water." George was off to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> cook-tent at the word, while
Haskins got Hugh on his side, the wound uppermost, and Frank arrived
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Boracic acid out of the medicine bag; Frank, you light the fire, and
then take off Hugh's boots."</p>

<p>"It don't look as if it was bad," said Haskins, when the wound was
washed.</p>

<p>"No," replied John, "I don't think the bullet is far in, it is the shock
that has knocked him out; but I have no instruments with which to get
the bullet out, and even if I were able to draw it, it might be followed
by a rush of blood I should not know how to stop; and then there is the
danger of blood poisoning."</p>

<p>"A doctor with his partner is building a boat at White Horse," said
Haskins.</p>

<p>"Good! I'll get him! George, you know what to do. Keep a good watch, and
when he comes round keep him quiet."</p>

<p>John left the tent, and saw four of the dogs before Frank's kitchen.</p>

<p>"See anything of Dude?" he called to Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was in front of my kitchen all the afternoon." Frank looked out
of the tent door. "Say! I've left my door open. I bet he's stole
something!" They ran to look. "Yes, a side of bacon's gone. Damn that
'dood'&mdash;'heap dam dood,' he!" Frank's sense of humour could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> not be
suppressed by any calamity; but its expression did not stay his
activities. He was out of his kitchen and peering into the bushes on the
hillside.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought so; there he is, been up to his cache I located the
other day; he's done quick work and is coming back. Don't call him,
he'll come quicker without, and he may think we want to lick him for
thieving. Come inside."</p>

<p>It seemed an age before the reprobate reappeared before the cabin.</p>

<p>"Don't let on you see him, but walk by and grab him," whispered Frank.</p>

<p>John followed the instructions and was successful.</p>

<p>"Where's the harness?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"With the sleigh at the tent. I'll get it."</p>

<p>"Here, Two Bits; here, Four Bits; here, Tom, Jerry," and Frank had the
team in harness. "Dude!"</p>

<p>Dude went to his place in the lead.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute."</p>

<p>Frank went into the kitchen, and returned with half a loaf of bread and
some fried bacon, in a piece of birch bark.</p>

<p>"Throw this into you as you go."</p>

<p>"How about the dogs?"</p>

<p>"Damn the dogs; I've been feeding them all day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mush!"</p>

<p>Dude looked back and did not move.</p>

<p>"Mush!" He moved ahead at a slow walk.</p>

<p>"Mush, damn you!" John felt surprised to hear himself swear; but the
dogs were in the condition styled "ornery." Dude turned in by the side
of the building, the others followed; the sleigh bumped against the
corner. Frank had Dude by the collar in a moment, and was belabouring
him over the flank with a stout stick. The hills reverberated with
howls. He hauled the animals back into line, and with a kick for good
measure, said in a cold slow tone,</p>

<p>"Mush."</p>

<p>Dude trotted off. Frank ran by the side of the team till they were on
the lake. "They'll go all right if you once get them away from camp, but
lick 'em good and plenty if they turn mean," was his counsel on
quitting.</p>

<p>John Berwick was alone with the team on the great expanse of Lake Le
Berge. Before him, to the south, lay the thirty-mile stretch of ice,
flanked by rolling hills, flooded with opalescent tints and peace. For
an instant the exceeding beauty of the scene gladdened his mind.</p>

<p>He was anxious about Hugh. There were forty-five miles to traverse
before he would come to White Horse. The dogs were travelling at five
miles an hour: nine hours before he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> reach White Horse; and then,
if the river were open, what then? The thought of the delay necessitated
by a journey overland staggered him. It were easier to travel thirty
miles on the ice than fifteen through the bush. He jumped off the sleigh
and ran; but the dogs moved no faster; and the labour in running would
soon exhaust him, for while there was no snow on the ice, the surface of
the lake was a coarse ice-sand, which constituted a poor foothold. The
sun was setting; already a chill was in the air. A crust would form
within the hour; perhaps the dogs would move faster then.</p>

<p>These thoughts ran through his mind, till his fear developed into a
lingering dread. He realized that to go through that intolerable process
of analyzing the details of his anxiety could only result in futility.
The surface of the lake became harder; he picked up pieces of ice, threw
them at Dude, and shouted. Every missile, with its accompanying shout,
brought a merely temporary increase of speed. All attempts to get the
dogs to gallop proved futile.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock on the following morning when Berwick pounded on
the door of the police cabin at White Horse, and was greeted sleepily.</p>

<p>He entered. The flicker of a match showed a man in the act of lighting a
candle by the head of a bed built against the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Man shot at the foot of Le Berge; bullet in his neck; wants doctor."</p>

<p>The policeman jumped from bed, slipped to the door, and pointed to a
tent by the river-side.</p>

<p>"The doctor with his partner live in that tent. What is it&mdash;accident?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Indian trying to extract a cartridge from an old rifle."</p>

<p>"Damn the Siwashes! Same old story. Well, I have no doubt the doctor
will go. I guess you'll need some sleep, so if those fellows can't put
you up, return here, and you can climb into bed with me."</p>

<p>John had intended returning to his friend with the doctor, but bolted
without comment, save a mere "Thank you."</p>

<p>There is no process of knocking at a tent door, so John used his voice
to rouse the occupants.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" was the gruff response.</p>

<p>John gave the necessary information.</p>

<p>"Doc," then said the man to his unseen companion, "there's a chance of
doing the Good Samaritan act the preachers talk about."</p>

<p>There was silence for a while as the doctor and his comrade were
dressing and preparing; then John asked,</p>

<p>"Can I build a fire outside and cook some dog feed? If you will let me
have some feed I'll return it, or pay for it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you was a chechacho!" said the gruff voice. "You want the Doc
to travel quick?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And the Doc's taking them dogs home?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, don't feed them."</p>

<p>John Berwick's nature revolted against this theory; but he made no
protest, as the life of his mate was in jeopardy.</p>

<p>The doctor packed his hand-bag, and was ready.</p>

<p>"You stay here," he said; "you can do no good down there. Roll in and
have a sleep."</p>

<p>Dude was alert, but the other dogs were in repose when they were jerked
into life again. The train moved down the river. Fatigued in body and
mind, Berwick gladly rested and slept.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>REVELATION</h3>


<p>John awoke at five in the afternoon. At the first opportunity his new
acquaintance began to talk.</p>

<p>"My name's Jim Godson. 'Shorty' the boys call me; sometimes
'Long-Shorty.' That's what you call a blooming paradox, ain't it,
Parson?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a parson."</p>

<p>"Well, if you ain't, you look as if you ought to be. What's your
name?... Oh, is it?... Ain't you got no appellation yet?"</p>

<p>"Not as yet."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll call you Parson Jack, though I guess you look too good a man
for a parson. Parsons is mostly parsons because they're too lazy to
work; and you don't act lazy. No, you ain't lazy; not if you are in tow
with an old-timer."</p>

<p>Godson's light chatter kept away the sense of apprehension which was
ever tending to creep into Berwick's mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say! I knew a parson once that was worth having. Yes, sir; Father Pat
was his name, and his run was down in the Kootenays. A whiter parson
never lived than Father Pat."</p>

<p>"Father Pat? Was he a Roman Catholic? The Roman clergy are not called
'parsons.'"</p>

<p>"No, sir; he weren't no Catholic; he was an Angle (Anglican)&mdash;and a
pretty acute one, too. He was moseying along a trail down below one day,
and was just turning off on a side-trail leading to a mining proposition
up there, when three fellows met him, who were just naturally full of
cussedness. 'How do?' says Father Pat. 'Where are you going?' says the
fellows. 'I'm going up to the mine,' says Father Pat. 'No, you ain't,'
says the fellows. 'But I am,' says Father Pat. 'We don't want no damned
parsons around here,' says the fellows. 'I can't help that,' says Father
Pat, 'I'm going up the hill; and if you fellows want to quarrel over it,
I'll take you one at a time and lick you.' And he did so. Now that's
what I call a parson worth having."</p>

<p>"And which of the three were you?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Me! I was the second fellow that got licked; yes, since then I've
always thought parsons worth looking into."</p>

<p>The time for departure came.</p>

<p>"Go easy for the first two or three miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> Parson; forty-five miles is
a pretty good walk for any fellow who ain't an old-timer. You're making
a mistake not waiting, for the dogs will be back here with the doctor,
even if he has to stay a day or two with your partner; but if you're
stuck on going, I guess I ain't got any string on you."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said John, and clambered down the river-bank to the ice.</p>

<p>The day had been more than usually warm, the air unusually clear; the
evening frost had come early.</p>

<p>As Berwick left White Horse it was seven, and already the crust had
formed. He had food in his pockets, and the air brought him stimulation.
Anxiety steeled his muscles. Away he strode.</p>

<p>He passed from the curving river, and came again to the frozen stretch
of Lake Le Berge. The light of day was gone; the stars gleamed and
danced, and shed their glamour over the hills. And what dignity they
held! Greece had risen and gone to decay: Cæsar had striven after his
great ambition: Pharaoh had succeeded Pharaoh: while those hills had
slept as they now were sleeping.</p>

<p>The influence of his environment closed upon John Berwick. The psychic
force of the weird Northland was upon him. Through his mind passed the
orthodox story of creation; and, again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> and again, as he walked, he
weighed the various arguments of the agnostic. He looked upon the
limestone masses to the east, and mused upon the ways of Nature, which
caused the destruction of myriads of shell-fish to upbuild the marble of
the palace. He pictured the diamond in the atomic theory of matter&mdash;a
mass of pulsating atoms oscillating within magnetic bonds&mdash;even as the
stars swing through space, guided by the influence which is called
gravitation. Was not this known movement of the heavenly bodies similar
to the theoretic movement of the atom?</p>

<p>A feeling of apprehension grew in John Berwick; faster and faster he
walked. Life's greatest problems had for years occupied his mind. He
looked about him and into the heavens. Before his fevered eyes the stars
shimmered and grew in shape: the earth beneath him dwindled and melted,
till it was but a star and he felt its rush through space. He realized
the centrifugal force that would throw the world out of its orbit; he
felt the counteracting restraint; system joined to system, swinging,
circling, driving; the universe grew about him; suns and stars were but
atoms in a component whole; the whole formed into Presence&mdash;Love! God!</p>

<p>It came to him as a mighty magnificent discovery.</p>

<p>He must hurry to tell Frank Corte!</p>

<h3>A STREAM OF HISTORY</h3>


<p>"Good-bye, fellows, wish you all kinds of luck! I won't be long behind
you."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," answered the four from the boat that glided out on the swift
waters of Thirty-Mile River. In the bow stood Hugh Spencer, bandaged; at
the oars were Bruce and Frank Corte; in the stern John Berwick, pale and
weak from his late fever, was resting. A new light shone in his eyes;
the lines of his face were softened. Anxieties which had been as a
weight on his soul had been removed by that revealing walk, which had
ended in catastrophe.</p>

<p>He had been found by the side of the trail some few hours after he had
fallen in delirium. The legs of his trousers were worn at the knees; his
flesh was cut through his struggling after he had fallen. His
finger-tips were worn to the quick; his blood had stained the ice.</p>

<p>The doctor, returning, had been John's rescuer, and had placed him on
the sleigh. Truly a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> Samaritan, he had returned with the invalid to
the foot of Le Berge.</p>

<p>Berwick's delirium was the climax of half-a-dozen years of mental
strain. His old struggle as to whether he should make his vocation in
the Church, as well as his almost hopeless passion for Alice Peel, had,
though even George Bruce barely suspected it, wrought upon him. Now the
climax had come; and was passed.</p>

<p>George, seeing this catastrophe, had guessed much; the doctor, trained
in the study of humanity, had also guessed something. Hugh, Frank Corte,
and Haskins only knew that John had played-out on the trail.</p>

<p>Spencer had told his companions there was nothing much in the first six
miles of the river, but that afterwards "she is swift and crooked."
Sunken boulders were the chief danger, so he took his post in the bow to
"read" the water ahead, and to direct the course, saying "Frank" or
"George"&mdash;as he wished the one or the other to pull the harder.</p>

<p>After an hour the boat came to a point where the river takes a turn to
the right, on rounding which the boat's pace increased. Looking over its
side into the clear water, John saw the stones at the bottom flash by,
and noted the scurrying greyling affrighted.</p>

<p>The boat swept by sunken boulders, or grazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> the curving shores, but
held its swift course without pause or incident. For four hours their
rapid progress continued; then the current died away, and the boat
floated upon the dead water that marks the junction of the Hootalinquia
River with the Thirty Mile, henceforth to be called the Lewis, till
Lewis is joined by the Pelly to become the Yukon.</p>

<p>Now that the necessity for vigilance was past, Hugh entertained his
friends with reminiscences of his first trip there, and the story of the
entrance of the gold-seekers to the Upper Yukon. They would soon be at
Cassiar Bar, and the mouth of the Big Salmon River. In 1881 miners had
crossed the Passes, and descended the lakes and rivers, to the mouth of
the Big Salmon, which they ascended, and obtained gold by washing the
bars. Cassiar Bar was not discovered till 1886, five years after the Big
Salmon party had done their mining. The men who mined Cassiar Bar had
wintered here, and their cabin came in useful for others who "mushed
out" over the ice to give word about Howard Franklin's discovery of
coarse gold on the Forty Mile, and to order more grub to be sent "up
river" by the Alaska Commercial Company's steamer. In 1880 some fellows
from Sitka had gone over, and prospected up the Hootalinquia; but they
did not strike much; while the first white man over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> the Passes looking
for gold was George Holt, who found a few "colours" around Lake Bennett.
In 1873 Arthur Harper and a British Columbia outfit came up the Liard
and over the Divide; but though they found "prospects" almost everywhere
in the Yukon, they did not make a real strike, so they floated to the
mouth of the Yukon and went to work for the Alaska Commercial Company.</p>

<p>Hugh thus told the history of Yukon&mdash;so far as the white man knows it.</p>

<p>Although the ice still clung along the river banks, the land was free of
snow, and vegetable life was asserting itself. The mosquito was very
little behind the grass-shoot in realizing that summer was at hand, and
that it had but a few short months in which to play its part!</p>

<p>It was because sleep on shore would be difficult, through the
mosquitoes, that Hugh suggested their continuing the journey through the
night. One watched and steered while the others slept. So Hugh, George,
and Frank divided the night between them. John asserted that the rest
and change of scene had done him a world of good and that he was able to
steer; but the others squashed his proposals.</p>

<p>"Heap dam dood! heap sick all same baby, he! he!" sniggered Frank Corte.</p>

<p>They had now dropped away from the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> mountains, not a snow-topped
peak was in sight; but the hills stretched majestically on either side
of the river.</p>

<p>The routine of watches having been decided, the party settled down to
silence at nine o'clock. Towards midnight John awoke. It was now merging
upon the season of perpetual light, and the hills and the great river
were weirdly visible. George was on watch, sitting on the thwart ahead
of him, his back towards him.</p>

<p>The boat quietly, swiftly glided on. No effort was needed from the man
at the look-out, save an occasional stroke to keep the head straight.
John glanced at his watch and saw the hour. The fact startled him,
though he had schooled himself. In the lands where his previous
existence had been passed the haunts of men were always at this hour
illuminated by artificial light and filled with&mdash;artificiality! Here was
the opening of the months-long day; and reality&mdash;Reality, the Eternal
Verities. In that wonderful silence he needs must think, and overhaul
his spiritual condition. He could&mdash;and he would&mdash;take Holy Orders. He
would first fight the issue in the goldfields, for, if he made money,
that power would be useful. So he came to his decision; and at last he
slept.</p>

<p>When he awoke the boat was hauled half-way up one of the Yukon's many
islands, and break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>fast was being cooked. The party had travelled one
hundred miles in twenty-four hours; three days more would carry them to
Dawson.</p>

<p>They re-embarked, and, as the same glorious weather prevailed, their
expedition was very like a delightful picnic. In the regions of Tantalus
Buttes the river took a number of great horseshoe bends, which induced
Hugh to remark, "We do a lot of travelling here, without much progress."</p>

<p>Then came Five Finger Rapids, where four great pillars of conglomerate
rock stood ranged across the river. The Yukon's waters were low; the
season of freshets was not due until the snow in the mountains was
melted and the sun had attacked the glaciers; so Hugh said the main or
right-hand channel might be run.</p>

<p>"Run her right on the top of the crest," he ordered.</p>

<p>They approached the rapid, and the current slackened almost to dead
water. They rowed the boat under the cliff to the right of the channel,
and then shot out into the middle, directly on the crest. The current
caught the little craft&mdash;there was a swish and swirl of water&mdash;she
heaved, and was over the cataract into the dancing waters beyond.</p>

<p>The current remained swifter than it had been above the rapids, and the
party was soon at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> Rink Rapids, four miles beyond Five Fingers. This
rapid was more dangerous than that of the Five Fingers had been, owing
to its being spread over a wide range of bottom and to the presence of
numerous boulders: however, they shot the boat under the right bank and
glided through in safety. There now remained uninterrupted, smooth water
to Dawson.</p>

<p>They breakfasted at Fort Selkirk, situate on the left bank of the river,
opposite the mouth of the large tributary, the Pelly.</p>

<p>Frank protested that a day's rest would do the party good, particularly
a dance that night, for there was a squaws' camp near.</p>

<p>"You will get all the dancing you have money to pay for in Dawson," said
Hugh.</p>

<p>As the party were again afloat, Hugh pointed across the river, and
remarked,</p>

<p>"Back at that bunch of bush are the ruins of old Fort Selkirk, which
Robert Campbell built for the Hudson Bay Company in the year 1849. In
1852 the Chilkats burned it down, because it was cutting off their trade
with the savages hereabouts. You see, before the Hudson Bay fellows got
in here, the Chilkats, who held the passes to the sea, used to give
inside Indians most nothing for their furs, and sell them at a big
profit to the white traders on the coast. The Chilkats would not let the
inside Indians out to the coast to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> trade for themselves. Well, when the
Hudson Bay Company showed up, it broke up the cinch the Chilkats thought
their own, and they came after the Company. The Indians then hereabouts,
the wood Indians, got hold of the plans of the Chilkats and kept watch;
but they let up for a few days, and the Chilkats came into the Fort and
told the officers they had to get. It was a ground-hog case, so they
just naturally got! Campbell found the local Indians and came back; but
the Chilkats had cleaned out. The tea, tobacco, and sugar they took away
with them, and what they couldn't take they cached. The Chilkats didn't
offer to do murder, though they are up to most anything. One thing they
took away with them was the Company's flag, which the Chilkats keep at
Kluckwan, their village on the Chilkat River which lies in the valley
just over the mountains west of Skagway. The Chilkats are very proud of
their 'King George man' flag!</p>

<p>"It was on August 21 the Fort was seized, so Campbell had to do
something right away quick, before the winter set in: so, after going
down the Yukon to White River, where he met the remainder of his men,
who had been to Fort Yukon and were coming back, he told them to go back
down the river and winter at Fort Yukon, and he lit out up the Pelly and
over the Divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> to the Liard, and down the Liard to Fort Simpson. When
he got there the Liard was running bank full of ice."</p>

<p>The next place that drew reminiscences from Hugh was the mouth of
Stewart River. Here was a police-post with a few cabins.</p>

<p>"In 1885, thirty miles up the Stewart, the first considerable bar
diggings was struck. Dick Popham was up there in 1884, but he did not
find anything&mdash;water was too high. Frank Densmore and Johnnie Hughes
brought to Juneau, in the fall of 1885, the news of good gold on the
Stewart; and in 1886 the gang went in, about three hundred. Along with
the gang went George Carmack, but he took up with the Siwashes on the
Chilkoot. You see, when the fellows started in first, the Siwashes
packed from what is now Dyea to Lindeman for nine cents a pound; but as
the boys were in a hurry prices rose to thirty cents&mdash;and this was too
much for Carmack, who was a Missourian; besides, he got stuck on a
squaw. I guess he must have stayed with the Siwashes ever since,
travelling among them and living their life till he made the big strike
on Bonanza, which started this here stampede.</p>

<p>"When the boys got to the Stewart diggings, in 1886, they found them
good all right, but not enough to go round; so a lot of them lit out
down the river, away below Fort Yukon, to try some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> prospects reported
from there. Among the bunch was Bill Hartz&mdash;'Web-foot' the boys called
him, because he came from Oregon. Well, those boys tried the lower
diggings, and found them no good; so Web-foot started back up the river
on Jack McQuestion's steamer called the <i>New Racket</i>. Jack McQuestion
was trading in the country then, with Arthur Harper and Al Mayo as
partners. He was in the country before Harper, and used to work for the
Hudson Bay Company on the Mackenzie. At this time they had four
posts&mdash;one at Fort Selkirk, one at Stewart River, one just below Dawson,
and one about where Eagle City now is. There was a big mountain there
called by Harper Teetotalim.</p>

<p>"At Teetotalim there was a queer sort of fellow from back east in
Canada, a Frenchman, who was always fooling round with bits of rock, and
talking about how the mountains were made. One day a Siwash blew in with
a piece of woolly rock which the Frenchman said was 'Asiebestos,' and,
if there was much of it, it would be worth money; so McQuestion sent out
Web-foot with a grub-stake to find the place. Web-foot did not find the
'Asiebestos,' but he found gold on the Forty Mile, as also did Howard
Franklin, who was sent up the Forty Mile from its mouth by McQuestion.
They came back out, and on up the Yukon to winter at Stewart. Next year
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> fellows left Stewart for the Forty Mile, and George Matlock, Billy
Leak, Oscar Ashley, and Percy Walker found Matlock Bar, with coarse
gold, which washed down out of Franklin Gulch. Franklin Gulch was found
in August, 1887. This was the first really coarse gold found in the
Yukon, and the best discovery up to that time.</p>

<p>"While the boys were wintering at Stewart grub got short, and Harper
passed it round, fair and square&mdash;not raising the price any. But one day
some stuff was stole, and Harper told the boys, who called a miners'
meeting right off. The boys appointed a committee to go round and search
the cabins, for every fellow was glad enough to clear himself by showing
everything he had. Nothing was found. And then the boys thought of two
fellows, Missouri Bill and Arkansaw Frank, who lived down the river a
bit. And when they struck a fresh trail leading to and from their cabin,
they became mighty interested; and when they saw where they had made a
fire, and found half-burnt-up staves of a butter firkin, they got real
hot. When they got up to the cabin the door opened and the two fellows
came out; one of them, Missouri Bill, with a Winchester in his hands,
swearing he would shoot the first man who came a step further. This
stopped the boys for a bit; but Frank Morphet got a rope off a sleigh
and slipped round back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> the cabin. The first thing Missouri Bill knew
he had a rope round his neck&mdash;and the game was up! Well, the boys didn't
want to hang them, so each of the fellows gave them a handful of beans,
or a little rice, and told them to get, thinking that mushing out five
hundred miles, and breaking trail all the way, was pretty nearly as bad
as hanging. They made the trip all right, but it was only because they
met some Siwashes."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>DAWSON</h3>


<p>Being in the vanguard of the multitude, whose rush to the diggings in
the following year was the outstanding feature of the history of the
Klondike, the Dawson that John Berwick and his companions found was that
of the winter of '97, very different from the city of five thousand
tents it was to become two months after their arrival!</p>

<p>An hour before midnight, when they arrived, Hugh had pointed out a high
hill, Dawson's Dome, placed beyond the mouth of the Klondike River, or,
as it was called before usage corrupted its name, the Thron Duik. Little
did he or his companions dream of the part this Dome was to play in the
events yet to be! The Dome was to become historic.</p>

<p>The main portion of Dawson was built on the north side of the Klondike.
It was a scene of much movement and business. Pack-trains were passing
up and down the streets, and innumerable dogs seemed everywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Few boats had yet arrived, and a group of loafers gathered to watch them
land. One fellow shouted, "I'll give you a dollar apiece for any late
papers you have!"</p>

<p>Now that they were at the Klondike capital, the natural impulse of the
party was to enjoy whatever amusements were available; so, in spite of
their being tired, and the hour late, they drew the boat upon the gravel
shore. Passing between tents, they came to the mire of the main
thoroughfare. The atmosphere and circumstance of the goldfields were all
about them. There were pack-horses and pack-mules waiting before the
shops. Men were hurrying in and out with pack-straps on their backs.
Even the dogs wore saddle-bags&mdash;a good dog being able to pack forty
pounds of supplies. Other dogs passed drawing a cart, on which were
half-a-dozen cans, oil-tins filled with water, dispensed at twenty-five
cents the tin.</p>

<p>The festive side of life was more marked than the commercial. Men in
wild attire, women in gorgeous raiment, were ever passing in and out of
the saloons and gambling-halls. The four adventurers floundered across
the mud and entered the hospitable doors of the Borealis. This was a
saloon and dance-hall combined; but a roulette-wheel and faro lay-out
invited to play. It was the interval between the dances when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> they
entered, and a loud voice was calling: "Come along, gentlemen, pretty
ladies here!&mdash;just in over the ice. The next dance will be a waltz."</p>

<p>Frank Corte&mdash;ever the squire of dames&mdash;made a dive for the rear of the
hall, and was soon leading one of the gorgeous creatures into the dizzy
whirl. The partners from the last dance were crowding the bar, ordering
drinks. As each man paid his two dollars his "lady" was handed a check.
This check was redeemable for one dollar&mdash;the girls' source of revenue!</p>

<p>The orchestra was good, but the male section of the dancers was
certainly grotesque; many of the men, with sombreros on their head and
cigars between their teeth, were floundering through the dance in a
half-intoxicated condition, their great hob-nailed boots almost drowning
the music with their noise.</p>

<p>The three others soon left Frank to his diversions, and passed out to
the street. They saw a policeman, with whom, in the way of such a
free-and-easy community, they fell into talk.</p>

<p>"What's the chance of getting a claim?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know. They are having stampedes right along, and any time you may
hear of good pay being located on a creek. When news like this gets out
there is a big rush by all classes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> and you're lucky if you get
anywhere near discovery. If you want work, they are paying ten dollars
per day and board on the creeks for shovelling in&mdash;so I guess you need
not starve!"</p>

<p>Hugh, with his mind on the immediate necessities of the party, asked,
"Where is a good place to locate?"</p>

<p>"Up on the bench on the north side of the Klondike over there." The
policeman pointed south-east. "You can get wood handy, and the water is
good."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with pitching our tent where we landed?"</p>

<p>"Among the outfit along the water-front? No, they are the sore heads and
general kickers. You don't want to tie to them. Most of them have lived
in these tents all winter, and had nothing to do but dream of what some
other fellow has done them out of, and how much better things would be
if they had struck it rich instead of McDonald or Carmack! No, you
fellows pole up-stream to-morrow to the Klondike, and then up that
stream half a mile. Pack your grub to the top of the hill there, where
you can live like white men."</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable, but we want to sleep now."</p>

<p>"Well, go to Flanagan's bunk-house up the street," and the man pointed
up a turning running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> at right angles to the main street. "He will give
you beds at a dollar each."</p>

<p>"Our boat and things will be all right? Good-night&mdash;and thanks."</p>

<p>When the three visited the boat next morning they found a man standing
on the bank, his legs&mdash;encased in rubber boots coming up to his
hips&mdash;far apart, hands in the pockets of his overalls, a sombrero on the
back of his head. Hugh noticed the smile of good-natured cynicism on his
face as he regarded the boat, and said,</p>

<p>"Queer, ain't it? And they say there are thousands more coming."</p>

<p>"Yes, fifty thousand more coming in&mdash;and me waiting for a chance to get
out!"</p>

<p>"I wonder what makes them do it?"</p>

<p>"Same thing as made me do it."</p>

<p>"Didn't you git a chance to stake anything?"</p>

<p>"Stake anything!&mdash;how long have you been in the country? Say! is that
your boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, take my tip and just get in it, and keep right on going till you
strike St. Michael's."</p>

<p>"For what reason would we do that?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know they have a Government in this country? Well, that's the
reason: officials and graft! Stake a claim, and they rob you of it! No,
sir, no more British mining-camps for me. I'm for the good old State of
Washington. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> this camp was in Alaska a fellow could hold down what
was his with a shot-gun; but here you daren't make a break. Law and
order!&mdash;hell! Grafters appointed by the law, and the law to see no
fellow interfere with the grafters! We'd shoot the whole bunch if we had
them on the other side."</p>

<p>"We intend to stake claims, and we intend to hold them."</p>

<p>"You do, eh?&mdash;well, I bet you won't. You fellows should have brought
your nurse-girls with you to teach you the A B C."</p>

<p>The party was then joined by Frank, the habitual smile on his face; but
his eyes were heavy.</p>

<p>"Cost me fifty dollars!" he said.</p>

<p>"You got off easy&mdash;better get in and cook breakfast to wake you up. We
haven't eaten yet, and meals up town cost two dollars and a half!"</p>

<p>"Say! if you fellows want to you can use my tent and things, but I have
no grub to give away."</p>

<p>This invitation from the new-found pessimist was accepted, and Frank
went to work cooking while their host let loose his opinions upon life.</p>

<p>He told them how the manager of a great trading company had the autumn
before addressed the crowd, prophesying famine through the winter and
exhorting all to leave the place by the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> avenue of escape&mdash;the
river, then filling with ice. It was a dismal picture enough, but
happily worse than the reality. He spoke well of the police, and praised
the way they had rushed the mail in and out with dog-teams. "And it
ain't their fault there is so much grafting; they don't graft
themselves."</p>

<p>He told of the fabulous wealth of Eldorado, Bonanza, and Hunker Creeks,
and of Alec McDonald, the "Big Moose," estimated to be worth
$26,000,000. He expatiated at length upon the irregularities of the Gold
Commissioner's office; the iniquitous Orders-in-Council from Ottawa,
such as the imposition of ten per cent. royalty on the production of the
creeks, and the reserving to the Crown of every alternate claim on
Dominion Creek, of all other creeks on which new discoveries might have
been made, and of the hillside claims.</p>

<p>Frank, with his Yankee predilections, was ready to believe anything bad
of Canada, and chuckled at the account. John and George, though they had
had experience of official corruption in Australia, thought the accounts
fantastic, and could not believe such things possible in British
dominions. "The Gold Commissioner is not in the graft; he's honest&mdash;but
he's like a baby, and the gang play with him as they like."</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the party set out, and in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> hour had poled and tracked
the boat half a mile up the Klondike. They passed under a crude
suspension bridge and saw two ferries and innumerable boats plying
across the river.</p>

<p>Hugh noticed a break or "draw" in the cliff, marked by a trail that led
to the bench on which the party was to locate, and stopped the boat.</p>

<p>"Get out the axes, fellows; and, Frank, you pack the tent up the hill.
It will make you think of what you have done with your last winter's
wages. John, you're the honoured guest&mdash;you're going to boss the job."</p>

<p>Berwick, without any load, found the climb to the top of the hill
sufficiently exhausting, as he was not yet fully recovered. After Frank
had thrown down the tent Hugh unlashed it, and spread it in the sun,
folded one end to make a pillow, and told John to lie upon it. And then
he addressed his partners,</p>

<p>"Look here, fellows&mdash;one thing is certain. Whatever we do as regards
prospecting and taking up claims, we want a home-camp as a sort of
headquarters; and we might as well make it here and now. We need not
bother building a cabin, but we can put up a wall of logs the size of
the tent and put the tent on top. This will do till the fall, by which
time we will all be millionaires&mdash;except Frank here, un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>less he quits
dancing! Now we'll pack up the rest of the outfit. Come on, boys!"</p>

<p>By four o'clock their new habitation was completed: two beds were built
and the little stove erected inside the tent. Frank had an early supper
and went to bed. The others built a camp-fire outside to keep away the
flies, and discussed mining far into the night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>POO-BAH!</h3>


<p>During the days of his convalescence John Berwick spent many hours
roaming about the bluff, indulging his passion for the sights of Nature,
and thinking&mdash;quite without panic now&mdash;of the infinite problems
associated with human existence in an universe governed by an
inscrutable Providence. Much of his thought, too, naturally turned to
the girl he had left behind him. His illness and these after-thoughts
had taught him lessons, and given him hopes.</p>

<p>In the steep ascent, one day, of the bench on the south side of the
Klondike, John came up with a tottering figure bent under a heavy load.
The man was old, and the temptation came to John&mdash;invalid as he was&mdash;to
offer to relieve him of the burden for a bit; when the man sat down to
rest, and wiped away the perspiration with a much-soiled red
handkerchief. John sat down near him; but for a time he paid no
attention to him, or to any of the passers-by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a nice day," John began.</p>

<p>"It's only chechachoes that talk about the weather," was the blunt
reply.</p>

<p>"I'm a chechacho."</p>

<p>"Don't have to tell me that: what in hell are you fellows coming here
for?"</p>

<p>"To stake a claim and get rich."</p>

<p>"Poo-Bah will get it!"</p>

<p>"Poo-Bah&mdash;Poo-Bah of the <i>Mikado</i>?"</p>

<p>"This ain't the Mikie-do's Poo-Bah&mdash;this is the Octopus' Poo-Bah! He's
got the Mikie-do and the Czar of Russia skinned to death. Poo-Bah comes
pretty near running things in Dawson. If you stake a claim, and go to
Poo-Bah and give him half interest, you may get a grant for it&mdash;that is,
if Poo-Bah can't find any person to run it for him! Then, again, he may
think he wants it all himself&mdash;in which case you can go to hell! If you
wants to start manufacturing hootch, just go to Poo-Bah, and he will fix
things so as you won't be touched."</p>

<p>"But are you sure? This is British territory."</p>

<p>"British!&mdash;nothing: this is the Octopus' country; and him and Poo-Bah is
old friends! Fellows tell me Poo-Bah helped elect the Octopus back east
to Parliament&mdash;or whatever you Britishers call your Government lay-out.
Look at this royalty they are putting on our gold!&mdash;how much of this
here royalty ever gets to Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> Victoria? No, sir; I bet Sir Wilfrid
Laurier never gets his hands on one-half of what's robbed from us poor
devils."</p>

<p>"But the expenses of Government must be raised, and you must admit that
you have good law and order, and that you never get held up."</p>

<p>"Held up! Law and order! Hell! What's the difference between being held
up by fellows like the Soapy Smith gang, or being held up by the
blooming yellow-legs? You have some chance of getting clear of Soapy
Smith&mdash;and it's only a matter of time till some fellow takes a shot at
him; but you can't get past the yellow-legs: they won't stand for no
bluffs."</p>

<p>"The Government will build roads."</p>

<p>"Roads! Then why ain't they building them? No; the Government says
Poo-Bah will build them, and has given Poo-Bah a franchise to charge
fellows going up Bonanza Creek trail twenty-five cents apiece, and for
each pack-animal two dollars and a half. Poo-Bah started to build the
road all right; but he quit just as soon as he got the toll-gate up!
What do you think I'm climbing this two thousand feet for?&mdash;mountain
scenery, same as you're doing? No, it's a mighty sight easier to climb
this blooming hill than to wade through Poo-Bah's bog-holes. The Bonanza
trail makes 'the slough of despond' look like the rocky road to Dublin!
But say!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> I must be getting. You're away from the land of dooks and
earls, and kings and queens, and all that brand of cattle; and you'd
better turn white man with a new set of notions in your head."</p>

<p>"Let me carry your load a little way."</p>

<p>"Go on! I ain't dead yet! It serves me right for getting caught in a
country ruled by a Government my fathers bled to get rid of, about the
time of the Boston tea-party." The old man struggled into his harness
again. "God! I wished I was back again under Old Glory."</p>

<p>John shrank under the insult. Tears came to his eyes. What soul
cherishing the honour of British institutions would not have protested
at such a state of things as his eyes were daily being opened to?</p>

<p>Sadness came over him. Here was a great injustice, and sordid, festering
corruption, inspired by greed. He gritted his teeth&mdash;and a resolve came
to him. If he found these stories true he would strive, somehow, anyhow,
to overthrow Poo-Bah and his <i>clique</i> of corruption.</p>

<p>After a while John again came up to the old man resting by the side of
the trail, who blurted out, "I thought I had given you enough to send
you out of the country!"</p>

<p>"Then you didn't. Tell me this, are you aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> of any case of a miner
being cheated out of his claim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lots. There's my own, for one."</p>

<p>"Where and how was that?"</p>

<p>The old man was not disinclined to talk.</p>

<p>"Well, stranger, it was this way. Me and my partner staked a claim on
French Hill, and we was sure first on the ground. We went to Dawson and
gave a lawyer a hundred dollars to apply for the claim for us. They told
him that we must have a survey before they would give the grant. Well,
we gave a surveyor two hundred dollars to survey the claim for us, and
we went out there with him. When we got there with the surveyor we found
a dozen fellows with rockers taking the rich pay off the rim rock. It
was three weeks before we got our grant. The Gold Commissioner's gang
took $30,000 out of it, and now we have the leavings, not worth much! If
we hadn't thought of getting the lawyer, we wouldn't have even got the
leavings!"</p>

<p>That was enough for John. He arose and pushed through the bushes on the
opposite side of the trail, walking in the general direction of the
hill-top. He desired solitude that he might think.</p>

<p>He felt fiercely angry at these wrongs. They were intolerable; they
struck at the simplest principles of human liberty. Here were men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
enduring privations which sometimes caused permanent bodily harm&mdash;John
remembered the snow-blinded traveller of Cape Le Berge&mdash;only to have the
fruits of their strenuous endeavour mercilessly taken from them!</p>

<p>Before he could control his indignation he had wandered miles from
Dawson, and gained the summit of the hill, where he sat to eat his
luncheon.</p>

<p>To the eastward was the valley of the great gold-bearing creek, Bonanza.
He noted the great rounded ridges, which, with their intervening
valleys, ran along the slopes to its bottom. He marvelled at the
softness and beauty of their lines, each of which ended in a
gracefully-rounded head, standing sentinel over the creek. And well they
might appear to guard its riches, for those heads contained immense
deposits of bench gravels that were to cause extraordinary sensation in
the days to come.</p>

<p>Finishing his lunch, he was idly working at the moss with his heels when
he noticed that the rock beneath was white as milk. He examined it
closely; yes, it was quartz, the parent rock of gold.</p>

<p>Immediately the instinct of the miner was aroused. He took a piece of
loose rock and easily broke off several pieces. These he put into his
pockets, and set out eagerly for home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> His mind was free of politics
now! A tinge of palest green was on the hills; this one day's sun had
burst a myriad of buds upon a million poplars. Yes, it was summer!</p>

<p>George and Hugh, coming in soon after John's return, were shown the
find, and all was enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Pretty hungry-looking stuff," was Hugh's comment on close inspection.
"How will you get water up there for your stamp-mill?"</p>

<p>John found an answer, as he remembered the long, gently-reclining ridge
to Bonanza Creek with its flanking valleys on either side.</p>

<p>"I'll take my ore to Bonanza Creek."</p>

<p>"But they won't let you take the water out of Bonanza Creek."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but they will let me have the water out of the tributaries
if I can turn it back before it reaches Bonanza Creek."</p>

<p>On the morrow George and he visited the famous&mdash;or infamous&mdash;seat of the
Head over the mining industry. They found the Gold Commissioner's office
a log building of no great dimensions near the police-barracks. A
waiting crowd was lined before the door. A policeman standing near the
office entrance directed John, who wished merely to get a copy of the
regulations governing the taking up of quartz claims, to ask at the
wicket inside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>He entered. As he stood waiting his turn he overheard a miner, evidently
a Scandinavian, applying for a claim.</p>

<p>"This claim is already applied for," said the official.</p>

<p>"But, mister, there vos not a stake on it ven I staked it."</p>

<p>"I don't care! It is applied for. Next!"</p>

<p>"Can't I see the Commissioner?"</p>

<p>"No; he's busy. Next!"</p>

<p>"Say! mister, this is my claim."</p>

<p>"Next!"</p>

<p>Poor Ole was shoved aside by the crowd. He had waited through the weary
night to gain a hearing, and now ethereal castles came toppling down!</p>

<p>As soon as John had obtained a copy of the regulations he and George
Bruce set off to the hill of promise, each to take up a quartz claim.</p>

<p>They staked their claims, and then followed the ridge down to Bonanza
Creek. They found that the rounded end of the ridge overlooking the
creek was admirably suited as the site of a quartz mill.</p>

<p>"George," said his companion, "I don't think my right will be of any
other use to me. I shall take up a claim here under the placer laws, and
I think you had better do the same." So each of them staked a placer
claim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of returning by the way they had come, the inclination to return
by the creek trail was too strong to be resisted. They would be forced
to wade through numerous bog-holes; but what of that? Down the hill they
scrambled, and came to a sudden halt amid the full activity of some
mining operations. A gang of men were working over a line of
sluice-boxes, with a big fellow, standing on a pile of rocks,
superintending. The water was shut off from running through the sluices.
The men had lifted the riffles out of the dump-box, and the gleam of
nuggets and dust was plainly visible.</p>

<p>"It looks good."</p>

<p>"It ought to be, after three days' shovelling in on discovery," answered
the superintendent, who flashed a keen glance at the new-comers.</p>

<p>"Is this discovery?"</p>

<p>"That's what I endeavoured to enunciate."</p>

<p>"Do you object to our watching the clean-up?"</p>

<p>"Not that I knows of. I s'pose the gold ain't going to evaporate 'cause
you look at it. But where do you come from? Are you miners?"</p>

<p>"We are."</p>

<p>"Do you want a job? Give you ten dollars and board."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, we have just staked claims&mdash;quartz claims on the ridge up
there&mdash;and intend working them."</p>

<p>"Quartz! this country is full of quartz. There ain't nothing in it; see
all the quartz in the wash here?" and the foreman pointed to the white
pebbles among the rocks on which he was standing. "You can crack these
all day and never find a colour."</p>

<p>"Where does the gold come from if it does not come from the quartz?"</p>

<p>"Where does it come from?&mdash;just grows, I guess. Gold is like potatoes in
this country. It was over there, just under the bluff, that Carmack made
discovery. He found a bunch of high-grade pay in the creek bottom and
worked it out; and then he had to go twenty feet through the muck to
bed-rock before he got the real thing. Now, how did the gold get on top
of the muck where Carmack first found it? There has not been a
good-sized colour found above bed-rock on any other claim on the creek.
I tell you if you try to figure where gold in this country comes from,
you'll go bughouse before you find out. Gold is where you find it. It's
a blooming conundrum. Take me; I came up here and could have staked in
on Eldorado. Well, I couldn't find a colour in the creek; but what I
could see was a sign stuck up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> readin', 'This creek is reserved for
Swedes and Moose.' Now, I weren't a Swede, and I sure weren't a Moose!
So I passes her up. What happens? Why, a lot of fools take her up and
she's the richest ground in the country. Nice, ain't it!&mdash;and me working
for wages?"</p>

<p>"Well, how do you know I won't strike it rich on my quartz claim?"</p>

<p>"You may, stranger, you may; I've given up calling people fools for
having different notions from me. Hope you will!"</p>

<p>They found the trail as bad as it had been described to them. It did
indeed make the "slough of despond" look like the rocky road to Dublin.</p>

<p>Few men they met but had some humorous remark to make; and there is
probably no toil greater than wading, with pack on back, from stump to
stone, from stone to stump, in the course of that desperate journey.
Humour was the saving grace; it was an effective barrier against
despair. Occasionally men were met, blaspheming, cursing the land, the
gold, the Government, but generally it was humour which made the path
passable.</p>

<p>A led horse waded into a bog-hole. He stopped, and seemed to hesitate.
"Throw a stick at him," shouted the man leading him to another who
walked behind. A stick was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> thrown. The horse plunged, and the bog being
deeper than the men had imagined, was more in the mire. "Keep him going,
it's the only way to save him," was shouted. Stick after stick was
hurled at the struggling animal, which became more and more bemired. It
gave up the struggle. The report of a rifle soon after told that the
horse was dead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>GRAFT</h3>


<p>John and his fellow prospector were working with hammer and drill on
their quartz claims, three weeks after they had staked them, when Hugh
Spencer and Corte paid them a first visit. Hugh scrutinized the quartz
his friends had mined.</p>

<p>"Well, this is poverty rock, for sure; why don't you quit it?"</p>

<p>"That's what we've been thinking lately," George confessed; "but what
shall we do&mdash;go to work for wages?"</p>

<p>"Better earn ten dollars a day than get nothing here after blowing in
your money buying grub and powder; but why not take a chance in the new
stampede to Australia Creek, that runs into Dominion Creek on the Indian
River side of the Divide? That's what we hunted you up for."</p>

<p>John and George gazed at one another. Not a word was said. John walked
to the tent and began taking it down. Four packs were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> of the camp
and the equipment, and the party, well-loaded, returned to Dawson. So
John passed from a place of many dreams.</p>

<p>Hugh had already made his plans.</p>

<p>"Australia Creek is already taken up," he said, "and, besides, it is too
far away. It's two days' trip out there, about sixty miles. My idea is
to hunt up a creek for ourselves. I hear the grafters in the Gold
Commissioner's office already refuse applications on the grounds that
the creek is all applied for. There was some sort of a row in the office
when the discoverers came in to record. Things is getting pretty bad
when even a discoverer is refused a record!"</p>

<p>"He, he! it's about time for Uncle Sam to come along," chaffed Frank,
exploiting once more his set theory.</p>

<p>The party reached the home-camp, deposited their loads, and passed on
into the town to make purchases for their projected trip. As they passed
up the main street they saw a crowd collected, yelling itself hoarse.
Revolvers were being fired in the air, and a frenzy of passion seemed to
govern a number of individuals. A man, wild of eye, and with a
disordered beard, came running down the street.</p>

<p>" ... man Dooey (Dewey) has knocked hell out of the Spaniards at
Manilla!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Frank gave a cock-crow, and was off at a dive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> into the crowd, where a
man, standing on a pile of lumber, was reading a newspaper. He would
read a line, then yell and wave the paper over his head. He would again
and again return to the headlines and shout them out. "Biggest sea
battle since Trafalgar!"&mdash;yells&mdash;cheers&mdash;revolver shots!&mdash;"Dooey ranks
with Nelson!"&mdash;more uproar!&mdash;"Rebels cut the cables, but the
<i>Eye-Opener</i> gets account by special dispatch boat!"</p>

<p>When exhaustion had overtaken the first reader another took his place,
till the owner of the newspaper was inspired to claim it and cry,</p>

<p>"To the Pioneer Hall, boys, and hear the full account of the biggest sea
fight that was ever pulled off!&mdash;admission only one dollar."</p>

<p>It is said that the celebration of Admiral Dewey's victory at Manilla
caused the dogs in Dawson, numbering many thousands, to leave for the
hills and stay there for the space of three days!</p>

<p>Having bought the supplies, the next problem before the companions was
to find Frank. They entered the Borealis: he was not there. Hugh
suggested that his two companions should wait in the saloon while he
sought the truant in other places of revelry. They remained, glad to
sit, watch, and smoke, in the shaded comfort of a curtained recess.</p>

<p>Presently a man of giant heavy figure, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> face coarse and brutal in
every line, stalked into the motley crowd. His massive forehead
suggested a power of brain; while his lower face showed the lines of a
masterful spirit. A part of his left ear was missing; and, from the size
and shape of the cut, one could readily believe the popular legend that
this disfigurement had been gained in a camp brawl, and was caused by
another man's teeth! To complete this awesome personality, there was a
cast in one eye.</p>

<p>A whisper went through the crowd&mdash;"Poo-Bah!"</p>

<p>This, then, was the prince of grafters, the all-powerful of that region.
As Poo-Bah walked towards the dancers every eye was on him; and if any
face denoted anything save disgust and loathing, it was fear. A girl
slid up to him and said, in a tone of confident familiarity, "Hullo!
Poo-Bah. How's my baby to-night?"</p>

<p>"I told you not to call me that!" he answered fiercely.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;baby?"</p>

<p>"No, Poo-Bah!"</p>

<p>"That's what they call you," she said with a strange affectation of
simplicity.</p>

<p>"Well, they won't make friends with me by doing so," he boomed, "and I'm
a pretty good friend to have."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ain't you going to buy the wine?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so; but ain't you got that thirst of yours wet up yet?"</p>

<p>"I've got to live."</p>

<p>Just then Poo-Bah and the girl, popularly known as "Round-Eyes," were
joined by two men. One was a strong big fellow with a bronzed face, who
had been a master-mariner. The other was Hardman, the record clerk of
the Gold Commissioner's office, evil-looking and a weakling. His small
black eyes were watery.</p>

<p>"Hullo, fellows! The lady has suggested wine. Will you help us clean up
a bottle or two?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing!" replied the "Cap."</p>

<p>Hardman was glad to agree. His eyes were watching the face of his lord,
with the same expression as shines in the eyes of a hungry cur watching
his master feast. Both the Cap and he had tales of woe to tell: their
troubles lay sore upon them.</p>

<p>The party entered the booth against which John and George were sitting.
As they entered and seated themselves, the two friends could hear their
voices through the hangings. At first there was nothing in the words
they spoke that their brazen natures would not have willingly advanced
to all the world&mdash;at least, to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> Dawson's world; but later the wine
made them forget. They had not realized that the wall of their
compartment was only a blanket.</p>

<p>"Two bottles of wine!" Poo-Bah demanded. The waiter brought the bottles
and glasses, and Poo-Bah signed the "tab."</p>

<p>"Now you pay that tab, or I don't get no percentage," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Suppose I don't pay," answered he: "you know these damn fools from the
creeks will buy all kinds of wine just to have the honour of drinking
with my girl&mdash;ain't that right?"</p>

<p>"I guess it is," she answered, with a cold unpleasant laugh. "Because
men are fools makes life easy for you and me&mdash;ain't that right?"</p>

<p>"Look here, I've got a kick coming," said the mariner, thumping his knee
with a fist like mahogany.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Cap?"</p>

<p>"I wrote the doctor to get me appointed as Collector of Royalty."</p>

<p>"You did, sure; and I backed you up: but I heard you got your
appointment in the mail that got in to-day."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, I did."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what are you growling about? You don't want to be told how to
make a dollar or two on a job like that!"</p>

<p>"It's going all wrong."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I went down to see Smoothbore" (Smoothbore was the nickname of the head
of the police), "and told him I had orders for him to put me on
collecting. I guess I may have looked a little bit as if I thought I
owned the earth; but I sure reckoned myself on easy street as soon as I
got collecting! Well, Smoothbore, he sizes me up a bit. I guess he kind
of felt I knew how to take a few ounces out of a poke and make up the
weight in black sand&mdash;and then he says: 'I guess I'll send you to
Thistle Creek'&mdash;Thistle Creek!&mdash;hell! They won't clean up a hundred
dollars in that creek this summer; and if you'll show me how I can work
a graft there, I'll be obliged."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, two hundred and fifty dollars a month will keep you going till
something better turns up."</p>

<p>"Two hundred and fifty dollars a month ain't even a flea-bite, seeing
what it costs to live like a gentleman in Dawson. You can't eat under
ten dollars a day!" His voice faded in a growl. Poo-Bah took up the
running.</p>

<p>"The thing is, we've got to get Smoothbore relieved from command here.
He puts backbone even into Hi-u Bill" (Hi-u Bill was the District
Commissioner). "We've got to get a putty man."</p>

<p>The others agreed cordially. John and his companion, who had before felt
like going,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> looked at each other, and silently decided to stay.</p>

<p>"What kick have you got, Hardie?" they heard Poo-Bah ask.</p>

<p>"Kick!" whined the little man. "I've got lots of kick. We had a row in
the office to-day."</p>

<p>"I heard something of that. What was the row?"</p>

<p>"Some Australians came in." John and George looked at each other and
grimly smiled. "I sized it up that they had staked something rich. I
tried to tell them that the creek they wanted to record on was all taken
up&mdash;intending, of course, to put you in on discovery."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;the cockneys just pulled five guns and said, 'Record those
claims.' I made a break as if to get the books, intending to get out the
back door; but the old man comes out of his office and catches on. He
turns white around the gills, and says, 'Record those claims.' Of
course, I just had to give record!"</p>

<p>"But where does Smoothbore come in?"</p>

<p>"He comes in all right. I'm just from him now. I went down after supper
to see him to find out if an example could not be made of the
cockneys&mdash;thinking if we got them on the wood-pile<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> we would have a
chance at their claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> after all. He was alone, walking up and down the
mess. 'Sit down,' he says, and I sits. 'What is it?' I had to tell him
the story straight. You see, he is a hard man to lie to, and I knew he
already had the story. After I got down to telling him of the old man
ordering me to record the claims, he says, 'And you recorded them?'
'Yes,' says I. 'The men did not ask you for any money?' 'No.' 'In fact,
they only desired to assist your memory to the point that you had never
before recorded the claims they asked for?' 'I guess so,' says I. 'This
is what you must say if you give evidence against them.' And then I
thinks a bit, and I says, 'You couldn't give them twenty-four hours to
get out of the country, could you?' 'No,' says he; 'if I do anything I
arrest them and bring them to trial, which I will do as soon as you
swear out information.' 'I guess I won't do that,' I says. Now, look
here, Poo-B&mdash;&mdash;, oh, all right, Smoothbore ain't with us, he's against
us, and it's up to you to get him fired." Hardman had ended his long
speech.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In jail.</p></div>

<p>"It might not be easy," said the heavy man thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will; Laurier will do anything our boss says these days: you
fix it!"</p>

<p>"That's right," the Cap put in. "Hardie's right again!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd be a long time in Nova Scotia before you'd earn two hundred and
fifty dollars a month! Eh, Cap?" sneered the girl.</p>

<p>"Earn! How much do you earn here? You graft same as the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Quit fighting," Poo-Bah broke in, and their querulous voices
ceased. "Cap, I think I see how you can make a dollar or two: and
you'll be near our friend, Hardie, here; besides being in a position
to pick up information for the benefit of yours truly. I'll see the
Gold Commissioner, and get you put on as special door-keeper instead
of a policeman. Guess your dignity will stand up under this! You
will have the right to let fellows into the office on special
appointment&mdash;see?&mdash;which will cost a ten or a twenty!"</p>

<p>"Not so bad!" slowly muttered the Cap, while the girl gurgled her
appreciation. "The thing looks to have possibilities, and I guess my
dignity will stand it."</p>

<p>Just then Hugh, with Frank at his heels, came in.</p>

<p>"Wait till I have just one dance," cried Frank, and was off to the room
where music was to be heard. John motioned to Hugh to be still. They
listened eagerly.</p>

<p>"Now, I've got some news&mdash;blamed noise those people make!&mdash;came in the
mail to-day," went on Poo-Bah. "Orders have come from Ottawa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> throwing
open the hillside claims of Dominion. I won't mind you fellows getting a
claim or two; but I want to get a bunch."</p>

<p>"You'll get hold of yours before the news is made public," suggested the
Cap.</p>

<p>"No, that won't hardly do," drawled Poo-Bah; "you see there'll be hell
enough raised when it is found I get a bunch of claims; and while Ottawa
is ready enough to take our explanation of things, there is such a thing
as being too coarse, even here&mdash;besides, it ain't necessary. No, in a
few days the news will be made public: till then keep your heads shut,
see?"</p>

<p>"We'll trust you to work the graft," said the girl.</p>

<p>"You can certainly rely on me! Now, people, I've got to pull my
freight."</p>

<p>Hugh gripped John's arm, but he released it as he saw the party were
leaving the box. The friends shrank back further into the shadows. When
they were gone he whispered,</p>

<p>"Did you hear that? Dominion hillsides to be thrown open! Some of the
richest ground in the country."</p>

<p>"I heard them talking about grafts, and I heard complaints about
Smoothbore&mdash;who ever that may be."</p>

<p>"The Colonel at the Barracks."</p>

<p>"They appear to find him in the way." John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> hurriedly gave some account
of what they had overheard. Hugh's eyes glistened.</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Smoothbore is in the way. He's straight; but this last
about Dominion is the news. We'll get in on the hillsides of Dominion,
and do our best to hold them."</p>

<p>It was late enough for rest, especially for weary workers such as they:
so they passed through the streets directly for the home-camp. Dawson
was now the home of twenty thousand people, ninety-nine per cent. adult
males. Its streets were a wide range of strange sights and wild scenes.
Its outskirts were of tents, and yet more tents.</p>

<p>They went to bed with the waking dreams of wealth very close to them.
John Berwick, who had some qualms at taking advantage of what he had
overheard, felt it was an unsatisfactory condition of things in which
such a malefactor as Poo-Bah could swagger and flourish.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A LOTTERY</h3>


<p>On the second day after leaving Dawson, John Berwick and his partners
camped on Dominion Creek, worn out and weary. Their commissariat was
equal to a three weeks' stay, and their tools and their bedding were
added to the load. Hugh remained their leader. While John and George had
been prospecting their quartz find, he had visited Dominion Creek, and
found many miners looking with avidity towards the claims on the left
limit of the creek, several miles below the confluence of Caribou. It
was to this locality that he directed the party.</p>

<p>The laws governing the taking up of placer-claims in the Yukon demanded
that the applicant should swear to the finding of gold. No quantity was
mentioned. John and George had met this difficulty when they applied for
the placer-claims on the Bonanza hillsides; but this technicality had
been smilingly dispensed with by the record clerk on the consideration
that nobody wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> the ground for placer. In the case of the Dominion
Creek hillsides, however, they determined to make discoveries, if
possible.</p>

<p>They pitched their tent upon the hillside, which rose in a gentle
incline from the creek. If any former channel ran underneath the ground
they had chosen it could not be very far to bed-rock.</p>

<p>They picked their four claims, and numbered them 1, 2, 3, 4. They drew
lots for them. John had 1, Hugh 2, Frank 3, and George the 4th.</p>

<p>As their tent was small they determined that two of them should work at
night-time and two by day. This also meant that a continuous watch could
be kept. Miners from the creek claims visited them, curious to learn
their motive. When they were told that the party expected the claims to
be some day thrown open, they smiled in superior wisdom.</p>

<p>Each of the four began to sink a shaft to the bed-rock of his claim. A
single man can sink a hole ten, even twelve, feet: but after that a
windlass is necessary to hoist the dirt.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the first day they all should work, George and
Frank continuing the watch through the night. They began early in the
morning of the first day, each on his claim. Each made a little clearing
around the spot he had chosen as the locality of his first shaft. The
growth was not heavy, and was quickly disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> of. By noon each had
made a hole about three feet deep. No frost was met as yet.</p>

<p>It was George who first reached bed-rock at five-foot depth! He went to
the other workers and announced the fact. Hugh had expected it to be
thirty, or twenty-five, feet at least. Their first feeling was of
disappointment.</p>

<p>The party gathered about the pit, and Hugh jumped into it. There was
about a foot of gravel above the bed-rock. Hugh picked out a pebble
lying directly on bed-rock, and smoothed over its muddy surface with his
fingers. His eyes brightened. It gleamed with half-a-dozen specks of
gold. He passed it up to the others, who gazed on it gladly. They gave
him a pan. Hugh scooped it full of gravel and scrambled out of the hole.
The others turned towards the creek.</p>

<p>"No, fellows, I've got a pool located up in the bushes here," and he
looked away from the creek. "What those fellows on the creek don't know
won't do them no harm." He led the way through the bushes. Arriving at
the pool, he dipped the pan into the water and shook it. He then placed
it on the ground, grabbed a handful of the pebbles, washed them in the
water of the pan, and threw them away. He continued this process till he
had removed the larger stones. Then again he whirled the pan in the
water, this time more vigorously. He picked out the smaller pebbles, and
replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> the pan in the water, whirled and shook it again, frequently
lifting it out on an incline, allowing the off-rushing water to carry
away the small pebbles and sand.</p>

<p>This process he kept up till but a handful of stuff remained at the
bottom. He kept the pan on an incline, which caused the stuff to remain
at one side. He moved the pan gently to and fro, with occasional quick
shakings; very gently he drew the pan in and out of the water, the ebb
to draw off the lighter sand. The residue in the pan became but a
spoonful or two, and now occasionally a golden speck shone and gleamed.
The sand in the pan became less, and some of it was black&mdash;the black
sand of the miners, magnetic from the iron which so largely composes it.
As the process proceeded the sideward motion occasionally carried the
body of black sand away, leaving a trail of gleaming yellow dust. The
black sand had at last all been washed over the side of the pan. Hugh,
with his fingers, massed the gold into a little pile, and muttered,
"Seventy-five cents."</p>

<p>"Three bob," George repeated after him. The pan was passed from hand to
hand for scrutiny and comment.</p>

<p>"Not bad!" said John.</p>

<p>"You bet it ain't!" agreed Hugh, "even if it don't rank with Eldorado.
This ground ain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> deep, and the surface can be ground-sluiced off. Let
us try another pan off of bed-rock."</p>

<p>The pan was again filled and the process of washing resumed. "If we get
two cents in this gravel a foot off of bed-rock I'll be satisfied," was
Hugh's comment. He got this time what he estimated to be five cents.
"Perhaps this is above average," he muttered. Your old-time miner is
ever a sceptic.</p>

<p>So while he was washing this second pan Hugh's mind was at work.</p>

<p>"George, I guess you had better go and chuck back all the gravel and
wash into the hole and get a fire built on it quick. The ashes will hide
the wash, and any person looking down the hole will simply think that
you have struck frost and are using fire. The rest of us will keep going
till we strike wash."</p>

<p>Frank reached gravel at about seven feet, and reported the same to Hugh,
who suggested that he should work a small hole to bed-rock to get a pan
of gravel from that point. Hugh cautioned Frank against throwing any
gravel out of the shaft to attract the notice of passers-by.</p>

<p>Frank secured a pan of dirt immediately on bed-rock, and Hugh panned it
for him. Frank was the only one of the four not a miner.</p>

<p>The pan yielded a little better than that of George had done. Hugh
suggested, significantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> that Frank had found frost at the bottom of
his shaft, which induced the latter to mutter: "Ground heap frozen all
same rock, no ketchum gold without fire, he! he!" This was supposed to
be a humorous imitation of the Siwash.</p>

<p>"Never mind your Siwash sweethearts, but get the fire in quick. I
suppose if you do strike it rich, or ever get this claim, which is sure
worth something, it will be heap klootch, heap dance, all the time! Get
a move on, or some rubber-neck will be mooching round here!"</p>

<p>Hugh went back to his pit, and both he and John had struck real frost
before Frank roared, "Supper!"</p>

<p>During the meal, and afterwards, the conversation was about the claims
and the prospect of their getting them. It was two weeks yet before they
could be judiciously staked. In the meantime, Frank and George could put
down other shafts prospecting the width and extent of the pay streak,
while John and Hugh were getting their shaft down to bed-rock. It would
be slow work for these two, now that they had struck frost, which
necessitated thawing by wood-fires.</p>

<p>"I guess we need a cabin on these claims," said Hugh. "It's more a sign
we're holding them down, and if we start building it we can kill time so
as not to look conspicuous, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> would if we was just to sit and do
nothing. It would have the rubber-necks guessing."</p>

<p>So the work continued upon the four hillside claims on Dominion Creek,
John and Hugh working at day, George and Frank at night. These two,
holding the vigil of the second night, again found bed-rock and gold,
twenty feet further up the hillside than their first shafts.</p>

<p>On the day following John and Hugh quickly cleared the bottom of their
shafts of the earth which the fires, burning through the night, had
thawed. They then set new fires, and sat in the shade of a tree while
they burned. The bed-rock on each of their claims was deeper than that
on the claims of their two associates, and both felt that their claims
would prove the richer, though neither of them uttered this thought. The
minds of all were planning how best to gain possession of their
discoveries.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Hugh, as he lit his pipe, and slapped divers mosquitoes
to death, "that it ain't altogether judicious for George and Frank to
perforate this here landscape with any more shafts. There is sure to be
some fellows rubber-necking here soon. I see some water has seeped into
the two holes they sunk first, and the other two will probably fill
soon. This will keep others from investigating. I guess they had better
get to work on a cabin, which we will help them with as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> soon as we get
bed-rock ourselves. These claims is mighty well worth holding on to, and
we don't want to run no chances of not getting them&mdash;which we, sure,
won't do if Poo-Bah's gang gets on to the fact that they are any good."</p>

<p>When the four were seated round the evening meal the matter was talked
over, and Frank and George agreed to start building a cabin. The work
was begun that very night.</p>

<p>Days came and went; yet neither John nor Hugh found bed-rock, although
each shaft was now fifteen feet deep. At twelve-foot depth a windlass
had been constructed on each claim, and the earth hoisted from the
shaft. At eighteen feet Hugh struck gravel. As John, who worked the
windlass, dumped a bucket of gravel, he would hide it by shovelling over
it earth from the dump. Finding gravel there at that depth suggested
gold; in fact, the depth to which the shaft was sunk without striking
bed-rock was sufficiently compromising.</p>

<p>At last bed-rock was reached, and a pan of dirt extracted. The pan was
washed, and a nugget worth fully a dollar and a half, besides about two
dollars in fine gold, was its product. Here was wealth and no mistake!</p>

<p>"Hi-u chickaman stuff, he! he!" laughed Frank. They all looked into each
other's eyes. Hugh gritted his teeth as he thought of Poo-Bah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> If there
was any extent of this gravel it constituted a fortune&mdash;yes, very little
of this ground meant wealth. How much of it would there be? Was this
gold of Dominion Creek pay-streak? He did not know: the great thing
about mining is, you never know.</p>

<p>John's shaft found bed-rock at twenty-two feet, where he got a good five
dollars to the pan. Frank jabbered; the others said but little.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the pan of dirt from John's shaft was
tried. After supper Hugh took a stroll. He walked far up the hillside,
and gazed at the tributary valley that ran into Dominion Creek, just
up-stream from John's claim. This "pup"&mdash;as the miners term these small
tributaries&mdash;Hugh noticed had been staked and prospected, but had not
yielded pay. He had already planned to use its water for the washing of
the gravel should he gain possession of his claim.</p>

<p>He then walked down to the adjacent claim being worked on Dominion
Creek, and began asking questions of the man at the windlass. He was
always ready to receive information, though he seldom gave any. The
ground on Dominion was rich&mdash;enormously rich&mdash;ten, twenty, and sometimes
fifty dollar pans. Up-stream the second claim was not nearly so rich.
The man at the windlass did not know the value of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> intervening
claim; it was held by the Government.</p>

<p>"How far are you to bed-rock?"</p>

<p>"About twenty-five feet."</p>

<p>"Much gravel?"</p>

<p>"About three feet&mdash;hardly three feet."</p>

<p>Hugh was tempted to ask how deep the miners, who had prospected the pup,
had gone before they had struck pay; but did not, because he gave the
man credit for intelligence.</p>

<p>"Black muck above gravel?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, or we would not be working with wood-fires now. Black muck takes a
lot to thaw; but, as it is, I guess we shall have to quit till
winter&mdash;but we have proved our ground rich."</p>

<p>Until the advent of steam-thawing machines, the Klondike miners thawed
their ground by wood-fires, which process can only be carried on
extensively in winter.</p>

<p>Hugh left the miner and walked to the mouth of the pup. With a pole he
sounded the depth of an abandoned shaft. It was fifteen feet. He walked
to the camp and found John, the others being at work on the cabin.</p>

<p>"John, the bed-rock at the bottom of your shaft dips towards my claim,
and the bed-rock in my shaft dips towards your claim."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The fellow at the windlass on the creek claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> tells me that he is in
the biggest kind of pay outside of Eldorado, but that the second claim
up-stream is not up to much. He has muck."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We have earth and broken rock down to the gravel."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"His shaft is twenty-five feet to bed-rock, and if we sank a shaft
half-way between yours and mine we would find it deeper than either."</p>

<p>"In all probability, yes."</p>

<p>"Don't you see what I am driving at?"</p>

<p>"No," John answered bluntly.</p>

<p>"You've caught on to that pup up-stream there."</p>

<p>"I have!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's only fifteen feet to bed-rock there. The old channel of that
pup runs underneath your claim and mine and is mighty rich. The gold
found on the creek claim looks exactly like ours: I saw some of it lying
in a pan."</p>

<p>John was watching the face of his friend intently.</p>

<p>"These hillside claims are two hundred and fifty feet long, and stretch
one thousand feet back, which means the chances are that the claims you
and I are prospecting cover one thousand feet of mighty rich ground."</p>

<p>"We are wealthy men," said John.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>And his thought passed in a flash to Alice Peel.</p>

<p>"Hold on!&mdash;we ain't got them yet," counselled Hugh.</p>

<p>His mind reverted to Poo-Bah.</p>

<h3>THE PEELS' HOSPITAL</h3>


<p>Alice Peel and her father, the Surgeon-Major, arrived in Dawson by one
of the first steamers from St. Michael's. It was late in the evening
when they docked, so they arranged to stay on board all night. This made
it possible for them to see some of the sights ere they retired. They
landed and mingled with the crowds preparatory to finding lodgings.
Alice suggested they should ascertain the whereabouts of the Rector. Her
father did so; and when he thanked the man of whom he inquired, added,
"I'll look him up to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Might as well do so right away, quick; he's always hangin' round
there."</p>

<p>"But it's eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Don't make no difference in Dawson."</p>

<p>Alice and her father, thereupon, picked their way towards the Police
Barracks, where, on the banks of the "slough," rested the little log
church. It was shut off from the street by a rustic fence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>&mdash;a peaceful
sight. Alice and her father were standing regarding it, and had almost
made up their minds to enter, to see if any one was about, when their
attention was attracted by a man in a boat mooring his craft beside the
church grounds. He landed his bundle of blankets, and was spreading them
under the church window, when a slight figure with bared head stepped
out of the door and stood looking at the intruder.</p>

<p>The man folded up his coat that it might serve as a pillow, and was
placing it in the prescribed position, when the Rector spoke.</p>

<p>"You'll have to get out of this."</p>

<p>The man looked up and stared.</p>

<p>"Say! Parson, are you any relation to the Good Samaritan?"</p>

<p>This was rather a poser; a suitable reply was evidently not ready on the
moment.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not, I'm sorry to say&mdash;but what's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Just broke! Besides, if I wasn't, I don't see why I need pay a dollar
for a bed when I have my own blanket. What are you&mdash;High Church or Low
Church?"</p>

<p>"I'm anything you like; but you'll have to get out of this. If you sleep
there you'll roll over and crush my flowers. But what are you?"</p>

<p>"Everything you don't like, I guess."</p>

<p>"No, that you're not. But the thing is, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> let one of you fellows
camp here, I'll have a hundred in no time."</p>

<p>"All right! I don't mind sleeping inside the church, if you don't want
the other fellows to see me!"</p>

<p>What could be done with such a man?</p>

<p>"But I'm going to have service at twelve o'clock for any of the boys
coming in from the creeks."</p>

<p>"I don't mind the services: singing won't keep me awake; and as for
sermons!..."</p>

<p>"It looks as if I can't get rid of you. I suppose I'll have to stand for
it! Roll up your blankets; you can sleep inside after service."</p>

<p>As the clergyman turned to re-enter the building he noticed Alice and
her father regarding him and his guest with some amusement. He advanced
to them, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"We arrived this evening, and thought we should like to look you up and
gain some knowledge of Dawson, and the manners and customs of its
people," said Alice.</p>

<p>"You have evidently been enjoying an exhibition of them. Come in and see
our church."</p>

<p>They entered the yard and walked towards the door, watching the intruder
wrestle with his bedding. They passed into the church, and to Alice it
seemed fitting that this should be the first log building she had ever
entered, the first roof to cover her in the New World. Being a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Churchwoman it was to her a matter of satisfaction and sentiment.</p>

<p>As they stood before the altar others entered, whereupon their host
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"It is almost time," he said.</p>

<p>"May we stay?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Assuredly."</p>

<p>The night was cloudy outside, and the church too dark for reading, so
the clergyman brought out and placed two candles upon the altar. The
father and daughter each noted the candlesticks were bottles. "How
incongruous!" thought the Surgeon-Major. The one had evidently held gin,
the other whisky.</p>

<p>The service was short, just a lesson and a hymn. Only half-a-dozen were
present. When it came to the hymn the clergyman beckoned to Alice and
her father. Each accepted from the clerk's hand a bottle and a candle,
and he motioned them to stand on either side of him. This they did, he
holding the hymn-book. They sang, "I need Thee every hour."</p>

<p>After the service the new-comers waited for the clergyman, and the three
passed down towards the door. The intruder was already making his bed.</p>

<p>"Say! Parson, that wasn't bad," he said.</p>

<p>"What wasn't bad?"</p>

<p>"That there tune; but I never thought you'd confess it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Confess what?"</p>

<p>"That you needed it every hour. Isn't that what you meant by having the
chechachoes hold the bottles?"</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't!" The Parson was annoyed. "You get out of here in the
morning, or I'll throw you into the slough."</p>

<p>"All right, Pard."</p>

<p>"Your friend seems somewhat facetious," remarked Surgeon-Major Peel.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are all friends of mine. They all know me: if they don't,
their friends do. This man is a type of what I have to deal with."</p>

<p>Then they settled down to the business on which the Peels had called.</p>

<p>"If you have the necessary supplies," said the Parson, "a private
hospital is the thing. There is a great deal of sickness now. The
typhoid is getting bad; too many living in the manner of our friend at
the church. Food poor and badly-cooked, general uncleanness; hard trails
and stampedes."</p>

<p>The Parson conducted the new-comers to their boat, and left them
satisfied and almost contented. Alice asked him, as he was taking his
leave, if he knew John Berwick; but had for answer, No. She wanted to
inquire at the post-office; but could not get near enough on account of
the long lines of men standing before the wickets, postal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> affairs being
in a state of chaos. It was evidently more than possible that John had
not received her letters, or, at any rate, the communication which told
of her coming.</p>

<p>On the morrow the Peels, giving fulfilment to their intentions, secured
a building in Dawson; and so St. George's Private Hospital came into
being.</p>

<p>It was a matter of much detail. Help and assistance of every kind was
enormously dear. They had changed their money into gold dust, and each
carried a "poke." Alice was astounded when she reckoned the equivalent
of the charge made by the man who brought their heavy luggage. Half an
ounce of dust meant thirty shillings. There were no idle hands in
Dawson; it was the hum of industry, except with the loungers at the
water front.</p>

<p>Alice worked hard, and her work brought distraction. Now she was near
John Berwick&mdash;at least, she ought to be, but had heard of so many cases
of drowning, deaths by fever and scurvy in that terrible country, that
she could only fear possibilities, and eagerly scan every face she met.
She stared into the faces of men of uncouth beards and matted greasy
hair; and, as was the custom of the country, her gaze was returned. All
seeing her, wondered what had brought this fragrant, gentle English girl
to Dawson. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> was so different from the women of the underworld,
hitherto the only representatives with one or two exceptions of
womanhood in that place. Her fresh complexion contrasted with their
painted cheeks; her simple grace with their brazenness and vulgarity.
"Oh, it was pitiful!"</p>

<p>In the shops&mdash;wherever she went&mdash;she asked about John Berwick. Only once
was she in some measure successful.</p>

<p>"I think there was a fellow by that name bought a bill of goods and said
he would be back for them later, one day, not long ago. He must be
living near Dawson," said the man.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" eagerly asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Because the grub he bought weren't the kind of grub men takes with them
on long trips; besides, he didn't buy enough to last him long."</p>

<p>She thanked him; and left her name and address in Dawson.</p>

<p>Alice was possessed of the faith that only death can kill, and that
faith gave her patience. She buckled to her work, and was content. Had
she been less industrious she might have found the trails up the
Dome&mdash;and to John; but no sooner had the hospital opened than patients
came pouring in. Nurses of experience were impossible to obtain. She and
her father had to struggle with the help of only one woman and three
men. All were untrained and inexperienced.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE LAST STRAW</h3>


<p>One night George ran into the tent, and shook life into John and Hugh.</p>

<p>"They're here!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Poo-Bah's gang."</p>

<p>At once the two were wide awake. Hugh stuck his head out of the tent,
and saw a number of men walking down the creek carrying stakes over
their shoulders. He darted back, and clambered into his clothes. John
followed his example.</p>

<p>"Where's Frank?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>George went to the tent door, and gave a low whistle. Frank made his
appearance. Each man armed himself with his two stakes, and made towards
the down-hill limit of his claim, and drove them in at their proper
places. One stake bore the legend, "I claim 250 feet down-stream and
1,000 feet up-hill for placer-mining purposes. John Berwick, Miner's
License No. T. 64859."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> The other was similar, except that it claimed
up-stream. The claims were staked in the small hours of July 12 in the
year 1898&mdash;the day of the great Dominion Creek stampede.</p>

<p>The party then ate a hasty meal, and took food for luncheon. At about
four o'clock they set out for Dawson, a distance of forty miles. They
hoped to reach the city by 6 p.m.</p>

<p>They passed the minions of the great grafter.</p>

<p>"Travelling early, gentlemen!" said one of them.</p>

<p>"Not so many flies," answered Hugh.</p>

<p>Occasionally wild-eyed men passed them, with a stride that seemed as if
it could never tire. This was an hour or two after John and his friends
had set out. These men had evidently been given "the tip" the night
before, and had begun to travel at once.</p>

<p>News spreads in a mining-camp with amazing rapidity, and the crowd of
hurrying men grew greater as the party progressed. It was also noted
that the fever was most marked in those who felt themselves at the rear
of the stampede. Those in the lead carried nothing save a little
axe&mdash;their body's sustenance was in their pockets, often consisting only
of a few pots of beef extract. When time for resting came the little axe
would serve to make a spruce bed. Covering was not needed in the summer,
as rest was taken in day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>time&mdash;often in the full glare of the sun&mdash;a
form of repose generally limited to negroes and savages.</p>

<p>The 12th of July, 1898, was one of the hottest days of the hottest
season Dawson had ever known. The thermometer was nearly ninety in the
shade. The land was parched for water, and the smoke of forest-fires
filled the air, which seemed to burn the throats of those mad men. They
coughed as they hurried by.</p>

<p>The party passed the Bonanza Dome and commenced the decline into the
Bonanza Valley. The trail followed the hog's-back which ends in Carmacks
Forks, the confluence of two branches of the Upper Bonanza.</p>

<p>The descent to them was rapid, and the steep ascent of a thousand feet
seemed terrible to the stampeders. Yet up it they stormed and struggled
till they fell exhausted. Even in the glaring sun men lay dead beat,
panting. They were twenty miles from Dawson; twenty hard miles yet
rested between them and their goal!</p>

<p>It seemed as if this stampede were born of frenzy in a last final effort
of the desperate gold-seekers of that year. They were close to the end
of the rainbow, where lay prizes for a few. There was no more of the old
affected humour of the road. Drawn faces and staring eyes were telling
of soul-strain. It was the last scene of the last act of a real
tragedy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>At the spring beneath a group of stunted spruce-trees&mdash;at which, more or
less, every man who has sought the glittering dust of the Klondike has
gained refreshment&mdash;the party of four halted for lunch. A dozen men were
already about it in all postures of fatigue. As soon as one got up and
staggered on his place was occupied by a new-comer, who would gulp his
fill of the blessed water and lie for a time inert. They came and they
went. Not a word was said.</p>

<p>"Where are you stampeding to?" John at last asked one, who seemed less
exhausted than the others.</p>

<p>"I don't know; just following the crowd. Something doing on Dominion,
they say, the hillsides. Some say the creek claims held by the
Government are being thrown open, but I guess not."</p>

<p>Just following the crowd! It is ever the way in gold rushes. No wonder
the man who had advised them to "keep on going till they struck St.
Michael's" had said it was a disease!</p>

<p>They passed on down the Bonanza trail; soon the majority of the people
met were other than the stampeders. The stampeders were in the crowd,
but the bulk were those engaged in the ordinary economic development of
Bonanza.</p>

<p>They passed from the Valley of Bonanza, after each had contributed the
usual twenty-five cents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> to the coffers of Poo-Bah. Here they were but a
mile or two from Dawson, and the flood of stampeders had passed. As they
approached the ferry they noticed a group of men standing before a
cabin, evidently examining something. They joined the crowd and saw a
little woman with an infant in her arms.</p>

<p>"My! look at the baby," said an individual bearing the superior dignity
of an old-timer; "it's the first white baby I've seen in six year; kind
of makes me think of home. You say it was born inside here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, right here in this cabin, where my husband and I have wintered. He
is off on the stampede."</p>

<p>"I've only been in the country two months, yet the sight of that baby
makes me think of a land where there ain't no Bonanza Creek trail,"
sighed a chechacho. "Ain't you frightened to live here alone?"</p>

<p>"No. Nobody will harm a respectable woman in Dawson." The speaker's face
shone with pride, which was not all that of motherhood.</p>

<p>The old-timer threw a nugget of gold on the baby's breast as he walked
away, desiring that the mother should buy the child something. The
contribution was becoming general, when the mother protested. She knew
there were many in the crowd who could not afford such a gift, and that
any miner would part with his last cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> rather than appear before his
fellows as lacking in generosity or holding anything but a contempt for
money.</p>

<p>To cross Poo-Bah's ferry cost each person an additional twenty-five
cents. There was none other than Poo-Bah's ferry, for his franchise was
exclusive. Many impoverished prospectors had attempted to retrieve their
fortunes by plying at the river, but were stopped.</p>

<p>After eating their evening meal at the home-camp the party passed down
into the city to take their places in the line before the Gold
Commissioner's office. None of the Dominion Creek stampeders had yet
arrived, and the line was its usual length. They knew that ere the
morning arrived the line would be much increased and hundreds would have
arrived within twenty-four hours. So, as nine o'clock came, they all lay
down at full length on the earth and slept, indifferent to the current
of life about them. This was the life of the goldfields&mdash;absolute lack
of conventionality and indifference to social distinction.</p>

<p>Just before John fell asleep he noticed some men slipping into the Gold
Commissioner's office by a side door, among whom were Hardman and the
"Cap." Mentioning this on the day following, Hugh remarked that they had
stayed in the office till late.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning a policeman was consulted, and Frank was commissioned to
leave his place in the line, visit a shop, and buy tinned meat and
biscuit. The policeman would recognize Frank when he returned and see
that he got his place. So the friends secured their morning meal.</p>

<p>As was expected, the morning saw the arrival of the first of the
Dominion Creek stampeders; they had staked their claims and returned to
add to the length of the waiting line. Their faces and appearance told
something of the terrors of their experience.</p>

<p>Bodies limp and eyes glazed, faces wan and expressionless, these were
the result of thirty-six hours of intense muscular and nervous strain.
The gold frenzy is the hardest, harshest, of tax-masters, drawing its
victims into such self-inflicted labour as, if imposed by an employer,
would rouse the protests of civilized humanity. Such toil breeds the
determination to have and to hold what is justly won, develops sympathy
for the rights of others, and will push aside the laws of custom and
society if they stand in the way of justice.</p>

<p>The office doors were opened and the slow procession began. It was an
hour past noon when John and his three companions stood before the
wicket where the whiskered Hardman was at work. Hugh came first, John
next, then George, lastly Frank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"We want to record hillsides on Dominion," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"What numbers?"</p>

<p>"I have lower half, fifty below centre discovery, left limit, and my
friend here has upper half."</p>

<p>Hardman grabbed a book and turned over the leaves to the space allotted
these claims.</p>

<p>"These claims are already recorded," which answer was not unexpected.</p>

<p>"When were they staked?" Fatigued though he was, Hugh's face was livid
with anger.</p>

<p>"At one minute past midnight of the 11th of July, 1898."</p>

<p>"No, they wasn't."</p>

<p>"Well, that is what the affidavit says which I entered late yesterday
afternoon."</p>

<p>John now interposed. "We have been camped on this ground for three
weeks, and have been on continuous watch. We staked these claims at 4
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span> yesterday. No stakes were in the ground when we staked."</p>

<p>"I can't help that; Joseph Trudean swears he staked one, and Ole
Anderson swears he staked the other."</p>

<p>"Say! have these claims been transferred?" asked Hugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, each has been sold to James C. Beecher, barrister, of Dawson."</p>

<p>"And the consideration?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"One dollar."</p>

<p>"Which would not buy a meal in Dawson!"</p>

<p>Sick and beaten, John and Hugh stepped aside; George and Frank passed to
the slaughter. Their friends waited for them. The time to wait was not
long&mdash;the second two being even more quickly disposed of than the first.</p>

<p>They went home, and ate a meal. Even Frank was reduced to seriousness,
his only possible return to cheerfulness being when he said, "He! he! I
told you it was time Uncle Sam came and took Canada!" John Berwick felt
himself prompted to say "Amen."</p>

<p>They early sought repose, but about nine in the evening John arose and
dressed himself. He had slept but four hours when he suddenly awakened.
Something called him to action. Hugh awakened too, and asked the time.
He, then, also arose, as did the others. No one explained why he was
dressing, or what he intended to do. Without words each knew they were
going to the city&mdash;the call was on them to enter the haunts of men&mdash;to
speak of their wrongs and to be heard!</p>

<p>They had tea, and set out over the trail called after the great Alaska
Commercial Company, who built it to the city. The flowers that bloomed
by the wayside drew the eyes of John, who, even in this hour of
disappointment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> anger, was alive to the beauties of nature. The
dog-roses, great in size and delicate in colour, greeted him as old
friends, and carried his mind to England and to Alice.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of Dawson was latent with strong emotion. There was no
noise. A malamoot howled, and those hearing him shuddered. Men stood in
groups and talked; their tones were low, their eyes alert. But in the
Borealis Saloon Joseph Andrews jumped upon the bar and addressed the
house. That he suspended the dance, which brought the proprietor many
hundreds of dollars daily, was overlooked in the face of national
disaster; for these men of Dawson had become as a nation&mdash;united and
distinctive.</p>

<p>John Berwick and his friends were drawn by the voice that came through
the door of Dawson's most popular rendezvous. Straining to look over the
heads and shoulders in front of them, they saw a man, red in face,
through the strain of his oratory, standing on the bar and
gesticulating. A crowd of eager men listened to him intently.</p>

<p>"I tell you fellows from South Africa that the Government of this here
country has got that of Paul Kruger done to a finish. Oom Paul is a
genius at grafting; but where does he figure, with his coarse schemes of
dynamite monopolies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> in comparison with the liquor-law handed out by
the gang of thugs and highway robbers who run this country? I tell you
the Octopus and his liquor-permit system has got Paul Kruger beaten to
death. Permit system! permit system! permit system! nothing! Graft,
graft, graft! that's what it is, graft! The Octopus tells the good
ladies down East that he doesn't approve of the liquor traffic; that he
won't allow any liquor to go into this country unless by special permit
from him! But what are these permits? They're handed out in ten thousand
gallon blocks, and there's enough whisky in Dawson City, and on the way
here, to float a battleship. And who gets the permits? His own pals and
the Jews. Jews, gentlemen, Jews! and the <i>quid pro quo</i> is a
contribution to this same Octopus's electioneering fund. Here,
gentlemen, under a surface-showing of morality and pink-tea temperance,
are true fissure veins of graft, assaying high in craft and subtlety.
Men of the Yukon, are we going to stand for it? Have we got to stand for
it? There are fifty thousand of us, gentlemen! Are we yelping coyotes or
are we men?" The speaker paused, that his words might sink in. His
audience answered with a yell; and then were hushed again.</p>

<p>"But after all, this liquor business is only a marker on the rest, only
a token. Dominion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> Creek hillsides&mdash;Dominion Creek hillsides&mdash;is where
Poo-Bah, our own Octopus's own 'Man-Friday,' has got in his fine work!
Orders came from Ottawa that these claims were to be thrown open, and
posters were printed and stuck up saying the time was July 14th. Then,
when the twelfth came round, somebody finds a mistake was made, and the
proper date is the twelfth. We rush the creek, gentlemen, and
stake&mdash;what? Nothing!&mdash;we get nothing! There are fifty thousand of us,
gentlemen, and every man has two rifles and a shot-gun. Are we going to
stand for it?"</p>

<p>"No," was the general shout.</p>

<p>"We've all been over the Passes and we've run chances&mdash;big chances; most
of us have had a handshake with death, cold grimy death! Can't we shake
hands once again? Are we men, or only mangy malamoots?" He paused; but
there was no cheer at this moment. They were all too eager for him to
continue.</p>

<p>"What is our situation, gentlemen? Look at our situation! We're two
thousand miles from nowhere, and those two thousand miles are
mountains&mdash;snow and glaciers! Talk about Napoleon's retreat from Moscow!
That was just a game of ping-pong compared to marching an army across
country from back East to the Yukon! just a little lally-gag. The White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Pass, and the Chilkoot Pass, and the mouth of the Yukon, belong to Uncle
Sam...."</p>

<p>At the mention of "Uncle Sam" a great cheer went up&mdash;a mighty shout.
"Uncle Sam! Hurrah for Uncle Sam! he won't tax our gold!"</p>

<p>"No, no, gentlemen&mdash;the Republic of the North!&mdash;a Republic of the
North!&mdash;we can work out the mines before trouble can come to us," said
the speaker.</p>

<p>"The Klondike Free State! The Klondike Free State!" shouted a man. The
crowd took up the cry. Chaos reigned.</p>

<p>John Berwick, who had pushed his way through the crowd, sprang upon the
bar beside Joseph Andrews the orator. He raised his hand for silence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>REVOLUTION</h3>


<p>"Is a man's life to be mere existence&mdash;breathing, and the eating of food
with hours of repose; or is it to be striving after some ideal, whether
of ambition or duty? Strife, surely! Man spends his life in toil; the
results of his labour represent his life. Imagine for one moment that we
are standing upon Dawson's Dome." The audience began to cough and
shuffle. This exordium was unusual. The men seemed restless, and then,
as if with an unanimous impulse, they appeared to settle to attention.
John went on, "We turn our faces to the north and view a mass of
gorgeous colouring&mdash;the shield of the day that is past and the herald of
the day that is to come. To the south and east and west this beauty is
reflected in blended tints, sinking into valleys purple and silent.
Whence came these valleys? They mark the erosion of ages: as a day is to
a thousand years, so is the life of man on earth to the time the hand of
God has been at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> work carving the original plain. And what are the
fruits of His labour? One of them is gold: gold that you and I may win.
During the ages when the land where most of us were born was under ice
the work went on: the rains fell and flowed to the sea; and out of all
those ages of preparation and waiting one result appears to us, and that
is gold."</p>

<p>There was an interruption or two; but the bulk of the audience clamoured
for silence, and got it.</p>

<p>"God is just. He who robs a man of the results of his labour is a
murderer to this extent that he takes a portion of his realized life. I
need not remind you, my friends, of our labours in reaching this land,
and the sacrifices we have made. Some of us have mortgaged our homes,
even sold our all, to make this effort. Many of us have spent the best
years of our adult life in this quest of nature's treasure, and in the
hour of consummation have been robbed&mdash;robbed of our efforts. The result
of those years has been torn from us, callously, brutally. Such
corruption can only be remedied in one way. 'Thou shalt not kill,' is
the Divine decree."</p>

<p>"But we have to get justice."</p>

<p>There came from the audience words of earnest agreement. The harangue of
Joseph Andrews had awakened the frenzy of the crowd. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> tones and the
serious presence of John Berwick appealed to their minds, while his
argument wakened the thought of moral right, and, far better than
rhetoric could do, steeled their resolves.</p>

<p>John told simply, briefly, the history of gold-mining in Australia, and
of the many times corruption had wrecked individual fortunes. Justice,
primarily, had to do with the rights of the individual. Countless lives
had been lost in the past ages to establish that principle. The
conditions in the Klondike were now worse than any that had troubled
Australia; but there&mdash;as in the Klondike&mdash;the distance between the
mining-fields and the seat of Government had been too great, and modes
of communication too slow, to bring effective remedies. The agents of
betterment found the diggings depleted, and the wrongs complained of now
irreparable. But there need not be any shedding of blood, that fact he
emphasized. What they must do was organize, and so win thousands to
their cause against the hundreds under the orders of the
established&mdash;and ineffective&mdash;authorities.</p>

<p>"But we need a head, a strong heart, to rule," John was saying.</p>

<p>"You're the man!" a voice shouted. "You're the man!" a hundred echoed.</p>

<p>"Parson Jack, Parson Jack! I knew he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> something in him." Through the
uncertain light John could distinguish Long Shorty.</p>

<p>So it happened that Berwick became the head of the revolutionists. As he
sprang down from the bar the excited men crushed round him. He whispered
a rendezvous to a dozen of the most eager, "Dawson's Dome, to-morrow,
noon."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That night Smoothbore paced his room. The scandal of the Dominion Creek
hillsides was known to him, and he speculated on its being the last
straw on the back of that patient camel, the honest prospector. There
was a knock on the door. He told the new-comer to enter. It was Sergeant
Galbraith in civilian clothes.</p>

<p>"There was a meeting in the Borealis, to-night, sir. Joseph Andrews was
talking."</p>

<p>"Did he say much?"</p>

<p>"A little more than usual, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he stir them up?"</p>

<p>"They did a lot of yelling."</p>

<p>"They always do when he talks. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"There was another speaker, sir."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"But you have charge of the Secret Service. You placed a man on his
trail?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Constable Hope."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did the stranger say?"</p>

<p>"He talked philosophy."</p>

<p>"Philosophy!"</p>

<p>"Yes; he's an Australian."</p>

<p>"Did he rouse them?"</p>

<p>"They did not say much; he held them quiet."</p>

<p>"Any sedition?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He says the man who steals another man's work is a murderer,
in that he takes a portion of his life; and he quoted the Bible."</p>

<p>The Sergeant saluted and retired. Smoothbore paced his room. A man who
could silence a Dawson crowd&mdash;one who quoted the Bible&mdash;was a man to be
watched! Smoothbore knew his duty; it was to his sovereign, and his
sovereign's authority; it was in his province to maintain the integrity
of his sovereign's empire. He knew that many of his men sympathized with
the miners, and that the miners were conscious of this sympathy. He
knew, also, that many of the miners believed, in the case of an uprising
of the people, that the opposition of the police would be merely
nominal. The question, what action he should take, had been facetiously
asked him many times; but he had allowed no man to read his mind. The
iniquities of the liquor-permit system were known to him, for in his
official capacity he had to enforce the law. The rascality in the Gold
Commissioner's office, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> the graft of the toll-bridge and the Bonanza
Creek trail, all&mdash;all were known to him, and were bad, bad&mdash;thoroughly
bad. Villainy, barefaced or subtle, permeated officialdom, but
officialdom he must protect.</p>

<p>There was no real hesitancy, although he recognized both sides of the
question. He was going to do his duty, and he knew that his men would
follow him.</p>

<p>Twenty men were present on the Dome at the time appointed. No one had
marked their coming, and it would not have mattered if they had. Men
often climbed the Dome to spy out the land or to locate the timber that
grew upon its sides, for it would soon be winter, and logs were already
being cut and hauled. From the Dome all who were approaching could be
seen; there were no walls with ears at that place.</p>

<p>John moved a resolution that a council be formed, representative of the
four nationalities&mdash;Australian, English, Canadian, and the United
States. He and George would canvass the Australians and English. Hugh
said he and Joseph Andrews would work among the Canadians. Long Shorty
thought he could round up a host of Americans, and Frank Corte said he
would back him up. These were men who would form the council. The first
thing to do was to canvass the town and find out how many could be won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to the cause, after which another meeting would be held and progress
reported. Following this, the creeks were to be gone over. To prevent
bloodshed the force must be overwhelming. Bonanza, Hunker, and Eldorado
would probably not yield many helpers. These creeks had been staked
before the advent of Poo-Bah, and the police had given records. The
owners had no complaint. Nothing more than moral support could be
counted from these. But on the new creeks&mdash;Dominion, Sulphur, Indian
River, Australia Eureka, Too-Much-Gold, All-Gold, and the rest&mdash;there
was little doubt that the support of thousands could be obtained.</p>

<p>On the hillsides of Bonanza and Hunker startling discoveries had
recently been made. Gold Hill was proved enormously rich, Adams Hill,
Magnet Hill, and Monte Cristo Hill were all of great potential wealth.
The White Channel was being discovered, and the rights of location were
hard to establish, if not impossible. In the gambling and dance-halls
clerks of the Gold Commissioner's office were nightly to be seen
squandering money on gambling and women. Their wage was two dollars per
day and food, yet many of them rather lived in the hotels at a cost of
fifteen dollars per diem! All this explained the difficulty of obtaining
record. The rightful owners of the newly-discovered property were
mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> residents of Dawson, employing lawyers in their attempt to
obtain just rights. These men were the most desperate. Then there were
the Forty Mile, Glacier, and Twelve Mile Creeks. There was a large
number on Glacier and Forty Mile Creeks.</p>

<p>The nature of the discussion was necessarily wide. John insisted that
they all should devote attention to the town for the first few days.
Each man gained as an adherent should be questioned as to his arms and
ammunition, the capacity of his rifle, and the quantity of his
ammunition. Notes were to be taken of these details. Only by such means
could they estimate what might be expected from the men on the creeks.
The need of caution was expressed by all on all. No word of what was
doing should be allowed to reach the police, and every possible adherent
must be carefully sounded ere he was taken into confidence.</p>

<p>John tarried on the Dome after the meeting. He requested George, Frank,
and Hugh to post to the home-camp and prepare a meal. A tremendous
responsibility had come to him in the last few hours; and now that
action had been taken he wished to meditate upon it. He had taken a
great step, and could only contemplate a result far-reaching.</p>

<p>When the last man had disappeared among the timber below, he arose from
his seat and wandered towards the wooded gulch to the north of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Dome, which he had partly explored in the days of his convalescence. He
thought he remembered something. He found it again&mdash;a cleft in the rock.
By the aid of a few poles and brush and a little moss it would become a
fair habitation, his den!&mdash;"David therefore departed thence and escaped
to the Cave Adullam ... and every one that was in distress, and every
one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered
themselves unto him."</p>

<p>Was he to be another David?</p>

<p>He sought the home-trail; and as he ate his meal told his companions
that he would camp alone; no one else had better be with him in the Cave
of Adullam.</p>

<p>That afternoon he placed an outfit on his back and walked to his new
lonely abode. Time was precious, so he would not allow any of his
companions to assist him, but rather requested that they should turn
immediately to their work of organization. Besides, it was his humour to
be alone.</p>

<p>As he chopped the trees necessary to complete his den, his mind
conceived many things. Fond recollections came, and they led to a
contemplation of the purposes of his life. Was he ever to be useful,
creative? Instinctively his mind avoided the immediate issue of events.
After all, the time for thought had given place to the time for action.</p>

<h3>WITHIN THE BARRACKS</h3>


<p>When Constable Hope had made his report upon Berwick's abiding-place,
and added to it particulars as to his visitors, and the council held on
the Dome, Smoothbore recognized that he had to do with a man of more
than ordinary character and intelligence. In the first place, a council
held upon the Dome's summit in broad daylight was not susceptible to
eavesdropping. As a base of assault upon the town, a modern rifle might
drop a bullet into the barrack yard. There were possibly fifty thousand
men against less than two hundred!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, six hundred officers and men were on their way to
the Yukon, via the Stikeen route: that is, if they had not got "cold
feet" and turned back. In any case, such military outfits were of little
good. Being a staunch believer in the Police, Smoothbore had little
faith in the Militia!</p>

<p>The report of the meeting on the Dome was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> to the effect that council
had been held and that the different parties attending it had
immediately left town. Berwick's former residence had been abandoned,
and its other occupants (who had been at the meeting) were not to be
seen in any of the dance-halls or gambling-saloons.</p>

<p>Crossing the quadrangle of the Barracks from the orderly-room towards
his own private office, immediately after reading the report of
Constable Hope, Smoothbore met Inspector Herbert, the officer of the
day.</p>

<p>Smoothbore returned the other's salute and stopped, which brought
Herbert to a standstill also, and then, glancing over his shoulder at
the Dome towering behind the town, inquired,</p>

<p>"Herbert, how would you like leading a squad of men against a trenched
position on the top of the Dome?"</p>

<p>"The only way a man could storm that position would be by flying
machine&mdash;and they're not invented yet. But you might cut off the enemy's
supplies&mdash;that is, if you had enough men&mdash;or their water&mdash;there is no
water except in the draw at the back. Were you thinking of having some
man&oelig;uvres, sir?"</p>

<p>"Man&oelig;uvres may be made necessary by the dread realities of war."</p>

<p>Herbert opened his eyes wide, and looked at his chief. Smoothbore did
not return his gaze;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> he was still looking intently at the top of the
hill, where he could see a flag-staff and the figure of a man. Herbert
followed his gaze, noted the human figure, and made to take his military
glasses from their case. But his superior checked him. "Don't look up
there with your glasses; some one may have his on us."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you seriously fear an insurrection," Herbert then
exclaimed; "that these dirty prospectors will show fight?" Herbert had a
contempt for the populace similar to that of Louis XV.</p>

<p>Smoothbore turned to him. "There are as many known murderers in Dawson
as there are mounted police in the whole of the Yukon. On that hill
there is a man who quotes Scripture; can probably string out his
pedigree to the Conquest; and propounds the doctrine that the man who
steals another's substance steals that portion of his life which went to
the acquiring of that substance. This is a dangerous doctrine&mdash;because
it makes our grafters murderers! The great majority of his followers
will absorb this doctrine without question. Every one of the
discontented is ready to lay the responsibility of his non-success on
the shoulders of the officials. God knows we have real grafting and
grafters enough; but if you would hear each separate tale of woe, or the
different tales of woe that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> malcontent will unburden himself of at
the least excuse, and add the whole together, the sum would involve
twice the number of claims at present made in the Yukon Valley. It does
not matter that these injuries are many of them fancied: the effect upon
the possessor of the delusion is the same. These men have endured
countless hardships on the trail: they have&mdash;many of them&mdash;staked their
all in the venture. The hopes they encouraged within themselves as they
struggled to the goal have given place to dejection. Now they find
themselves at the end of their resources, and their ways are blocked by
corruption! Can you not understand how little organized agitation will
ferment rebellion?"</p>

<p>"And they have abundant ammunition," commented Herbert, ever-practical.</p>

<p>"They brought a great supply with them, thinking to kill game on the
way. They met little or none, and consequently have their ammunition
unspent. Look in at any of the second-hand shops, and you will find
numbers of the highest class of modern rifles, with stacks of
ammunition, on sale at half their original cost."</p>

<p>"Then you really fear rebellion?"</p>

<p>"Not fear, but I think rebellion is not improbable. Officers of the
mounted police don't fear anything this side of the Great Divide," and
the speaker smiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would it not be well to arrest the ringleaders, and nip the thing in
the bud?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"We have no charge to lay against them, except the voicing of sedition;
and there was only one man who did so. And if we did arrest him&mdash;no! it
would not do! Besides: sedition!&mdash;there are enough people voicing
sedition within earshot of Whitehall to keep the prisons of England
filled were they all arrested. It would be a hard thing to get a jury to
convict on a charge of sedition."</p>

<p>With this the Commandant continued his way to his office.</p>

<p>Smoothbore sat at his desk, and filled his pipe. His conversation with
his Inspector had not dispelled his apprehensions&mdash;far from it. He must
do something. He turned to the constable who was busy with papers at a
neighbouring desk, and sent him for Sergeant Galbraith. In the meantime
he sat and thought. There were few Canadians in the total population of
the Yukon, while the English and Australians were the most bitter
against the existing wrongs, and foremost in their utterances of
protest.</p>

<p>In due time Sergeant Galbraith entered and saluted. Smoothbore turned to
him,</p>

<p>"Constable Hope has not been able to find any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> trace of the associates
of Berwick at their tent, nor in the dance-halls?"</p>

<p>"He has not, sir."</p>

<p>"They appear to have left town. It is clear that they are organizing,
which means trouble. What is Hope doing?"</p>

<p>"Detailed to watch the Dome, sir."</p>

<p>"You had better put another man on that job, and send Hope to the Forks,
and on through to Dominion, if needs be, to see if he can pick up any
trace of these men, and if so to ascertain what they are doing. He might
travel in plain clothes. It is possible he may give the appearance of
being a likely recruit for the Klondike Free State."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you see any signs of organization?"</p>

<p>"Nothing further, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, have a look in at these second-hand shops that have the most
rifles and ammunition in stock, and size up what they have. Then you can
see later if much is being sold. You might ask the proprietors to find
out where the purchasers say they are going. The explanation for your
questions will be that you understand there has been a new find made
somewhere, and that you wish to ascertain where it is."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that, if a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> rebels entrenched
themselves on the summit of the Dome, there would be no dislodging them,
while they could drop bullets into any part of the town, including the
Police Barracks!</p>

<p>Smoothbore had small hopes of securing any number of recruits from the
civilian population. No, the civilian population would take little hand
in suppressing a rising. There was no end to be served by the Police
making the first move; they could only wait and watch, hoping for
something to turn up. The humour of the malcontents might change; some
new distraction might spring up. The British Empire had been on the
verge of collapse a score of times, but always something had happened to
floor the prophets. He was quite ready to believe that the man at the
head of the new movement&mdash;this John Berwick&mdash;was steadfast in his
affection for the British Crown; quite possibly his action in the matter
grew out of his loyalty. And being right in this reflection goes to show
how worldly-wise the Police Commandant really was. That in a crisis,
such as was being developed, he proved strong enough to lie low,
illustrates the moral and physical courage of the man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>RECRUITING</h3>


<p>That Frank, Hugh, and George had not returned to their tent the night
after the council of war on the Dome was due to nothing more than the
fact that they had gone to town with Long Shorty, and had stayed the
night in his cabin. They did not appear in the saloons and dance-halls
because they had decided upon Baxter's Free Library as down-town
headquarters. Hence it was that two astute policemen had made wrong
deductions; and while Constable Hope was haunting the resorts on the
creeks for them, they were actually in the heart of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The selection of Baxter's Free Library was the result of the astuteness
of Long Shorty. He knew the place. Only in Dawson would it have been
worthy of the name of library, as the number of volumes was limited to a
score or so. There were also several newspapers there, which, though
thumbed and scrawled upon and tattered, were the latest the camp
contained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Access to these newspapers and books was free, the revenue of the
establishment being derived from a lunch counter. As the building was
located one street back from that which ran along the water front, the
rent paid was comparatively small; and the proprietor was able to serve
a roll and a cup of coffee for fifty cents, and a plate of stew, made of
bully beef, or pork and beans, for a dollar and a half, which was about
33 per cent. cheaper than fashionable prices!</p>

<p>The combination of comparatively cheap food and free reading drew to
Baxter's many of those who had ample time upon their hands, with little
or no money in their pockets, and who were unwilling, or unable, to
perform the heavy labour of mining operations on the creeks. They were
of the educated and semi-educated classes; and among their motley
members Long Shorty guessed that many desperate characters might be
found. A winter&mdash;the most severe in which white people lived&mdash;would be
upon them in a few short months.</p>

<p>The plan of campaign decided upon was that each of the four conspirators
should enter the reading-room, engage in reading, and gradually draw
possible recruits into conversation&mdash;which in free-and-easy Dawson would
not be difficult to do.</p>

<p>Long Shorty was not long in picking out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> man. He seemed the ordinary
type of prospector, well-set-up and muscular; his dress was of good
quality, by which it was to be inferred that his outfit would be large,
and in all probability would include a rifle or two with ammunition. He
was reading a copy of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Long Shorty sat beside him, and picked up a copy of the Bible. Bibles
and the works of William Shakespeare were the most common volumes in
Dawson in the summer of '98. Long Shorty turned over the pages, read a
verse, then put down the book, and sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, stranger," he said, "what do you think of things?"</p>

<p>"Damned bad."</p>

<p>"They sure are; but what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Just about the same as the rest; get out of the country as soon as I
can. Isn't that what you're going to do?"</p>

<p>"I guess so&mdash;after I've made my pile!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you get away with a pile, I reckon you'll have to make two:
one for yourself and one for the grafters."</p>

<p>"There may be a change."</p>

<p>"You must have been listening to the fellow down at the Borealis the
other night."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was," said Long Shorty significantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you think those fellows will ever do more than talk?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know how many police there are, and how many there are of the
others. The police are armed with old Winchesters, twenty years behind
the times! Looks like the insurrectoes might have a chance if they got
together and had ammunition and rifles."</p>

<p>"There are lots of both among the crowd, I guess. I have a 303 and a
thousand cartridges; that is, five shots for every policeman in the
country." He spoke with some bitterness.</p>

<p>Long Shorty rightly concluded that here was a spirit who only wanted a
leader. To make doubly sure he thought he would draw him a little and
see how much real mutiny was in his heart; so he said,</p>

<p>"But there are the claim-owners, grafters, and other civilians who might
aid the police."</p>

<p>"Not much! The claim-owners wouldn't, except possibly those who got
their holdings through Poo-Bah. The fellows who got their claims
straight would know a new Government would do them more good than harm."</p>

<p>The speaker then, as if tired of politics, pointedly went on with his
reading; his mind was absorbing the philosophy of the melancholy
Jacques.</p>

<p>Long Shorty's sensibilities were not of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> finest, and he refused to
consider the conversation closed; so he asked the direct question,</p>

<p>"What would you do if the boys got up?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!&mdash;I'd do nothing. It's no use considering it: I'm off down the
river on a steamer leaving to-morrow. I'm going to work my way as a
wood-passer to St. Michael's, after which I'll trust to luck for getting
to 'Frisco. But if the boys are really going to rise, they have my good
wishes. I tried to sell my rifle to-day, and the best offer I could get
was five dollars&mdash;and I told the fellow I'd chuck it into the Yukon
first. If you are going to stay I'll make you a present of it, to be
given to the boys if they want it."</p>

<p>The man was going home. Long Shorty felt there was no use in attempting
to hold him; so he answered in such a manner as to accept the offer, and
yet not compromise himself. He said, "I don't mind taking the rifle and
the cartridges and holding them in case things do happen&mdash;though I may
be away on the creeks at the time."</p>

<p>"All right, I leave them with Baxter here; you can call for them
to-morrow." Again he returned to the Forest of Arden, and Long Shorty
permitted the conversation to close.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the other three had been hard at work. George met one
Australian whose sentiments were so pronounced that he quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> closed
with him; and as the recruit knew several others in the library, the
agitation made good progress.</p>

<p>It was agreed by the reformers and the new recruits that they should all
meet later in the day at Lookout Point, which was the angle of the
Klondike Bluffs, where the valley of the Klondike met that of the Yukon.
In later years a seat and a flag-staff were erected there, and it became
a favourite trysting-place for young men and maidens engaged in another
quest than that of gold.</p>

<p>This arrangement settled, George set off to report to Berwick, while the
others, still looking for more of the rightly disaffected, drifted into
the different saloons.</p>

<p>Berwick was delighted at their present success, and was eager to meet
the party at Lookout Point. He felt that if so many adherents could be
gained by such a small canvass, three or four thousand devoted armed
men, at least, could be recruited from Dawson and its environs. The
outlook was hopeful.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;"/><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>LOCATED</h3>


<p>In due course, that is three or four days afterwards, Constable Hope
returned from the creeks with the report that there was no trace to be
found of the allies of John Berwick. To Smoothbore this was not evidence
of any abandonment of the conspiracy. He was convinced that Berwick
meant business. There was, besides, a strange quietude reigning over
Dawson. So mercurial a population could not have let its excitement
subside and disappear in that short time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Inspector Herbert was confident enough to be
facetious at the expense of the enemies of officialdom. When Smoothbore
told him that Hope's expedition had no result, he said,</p>

<p>"I thought as much; you'll find the reputed leader has some fool theory
of the origin of gold, and is camped on the Dome to receive inspiration,
while his followers have slipped off down the river for the good of
their healths."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Smoothbore as he glanced at the Dome. "Perhaps!" and
they parted.</p>

<p>"The old man is a bit locoed on this rebellion theory," mused Herbert as
he went along. "It's strange in a man who has seen so much service, and
with him it is not 'nerves.'" Just then Herbert happened to glance up at
the Dome. "By Jove! what a position for a couple of maxims. One hundred
men could stand off ten thousand. I wonder! There are thousands of men
starving, with many too proud to beg, and little to spare even for them.
What would a successful revolution mean? For one thing, it would
establish a multitude of openings in the new Civil Service&mdash;with chances
of graft. It would mean a new police force, or militia, perhaps both,
the members of which would, at least, be fed. It is not a case so much
of righting wrong, as of getting for these fellows a piece of the
pumpkin. Taking that view of it, it looks serious. What if the old man
were right!" Such were the thoughts that flashed through Herbert's mind.</p>

<p>Almost within a minute after Smoothbore had left him he was wavering in
his opinions; now he was striding in pursuit of him.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what do you think we had better do about it," asked the
Commandant, after he had heard the changed opinions of his Inspector.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arrest the leaders!"</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by a knock at the office-door, which
was followed by the entrance of Constable Hope, quite in a fluster.</p>

<p>"I have located Berwick's friends, sir," he reported, "in fact he was
with them when I spotted them. They were all in Baxter's Free Library,
and they are up to something. Berwick sits reading the Bible, and every
now and then one of his aides-de-camp comes up and whispers in his ear,
and then goes away to begin opening conversation with some pilgrim. I
sat down, thinking one of them might come to me with his talk, but no
results, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, now you have them located, take two good men in plain clothes and
point the gang out to them; in fact, you might take four, so that
henceforth they can be easily traced. Detail one man to Berwick and two
to the others."</p>

<p>"Good man, that," remarked Herbert, when Hope had left their presence.</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be a pity to have him in the Army."</p>

<p>"My guess seems to have been wrong as to the movements of the gang."</p>

<p>Smoothbore made no comment on this, but asked,</p>

<p>"Would you arrest them now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid I must still disagree with you," was the Chief's answer,
and Herbert shortly after went away.</p>

<p>Constable Hope collected together four of his comrades, told them to
dress in civilian clothes and follow him. They did so and joined the
crowd in Baxter's. In due time the four policemen had registered in
their memory the features of John Berwick and his followers. Constable
Hope then told off three men according to instructions, and with the
remaining policeman left the place.</p>

<p>"Who are those fellows?" asked the Constable who accompanied Hope.</p>

<p>"Berwick is the prospective liberator of the oppressed and down-trodden
miner. He can talk on occasions; in fact I heard him and nearly
determined to jump my uniform."</p>

<p>"What do they propose to do?"</p>

<p>"Send the police down the river, and set up for themselves!"</p>

<p>"Cheerful for us! Do you think they will make the effort?"</p>

<p>"Smoothbore seems to take them seriously, and I think Herbert is coming
to think the same way."</p>

<p>"What will Smoothbore do?"</p>

<p>"Stand pat! What else would he do? What would you or I do?" and
Constable Hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> looked at his companion in a manner not complimentary.</p>

<p>"The outfit would surely get licked in the end."</p>

<p>"To be sure they would!&mdash;but in the meantime, two years: how much could
you graft in two years?"</p>

<p>This query admitted of no reply, and lacking a further word from his
companion, Constable Hope continued,</p>

<p>"Fifty miles, ten hours on the river&mdash;and you are in the land of Uncle
Sam! See?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see."</p>

<p>"If you think over it a bit you will see more."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess my vision would enlarge; and you say Smoothbore is only
standing pat?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Funny!"</p>

<p>"It's not funny: it's the only thing to do; they have not begun to mass
their forces yet. When they do we might have some evidence."</p>

<p>Shortly after Hope and Inspector Herbert had left Smoothbore, Sergeant
Galbraith knocked at the office door, and reported.</p>

<p>"I've looked into the second-hand shops, and sized up their ammunition.
Rosenbaum on Second Street reports considerable buying lately, and so
does Hobson on Third Avenue. In fact, sir, they appeared to be somewhat
excited. The Jew thought there was a strike up the Klondike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> and the
Cockney thought there must be a stampede up the Stewart."</p>

<p>"Perhaps these stories may be right!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I think not. The town patrol reported to-day two fellows in
from Wind City, sir, on the Edmonton Trail, and I looked them up. They
had not met any fellows going up the Stewart; that is, any number worth
mentioning."</p>

<p>"Then this looks like corroborative evidence: at least the trouble is
reaching such a stage as to make it advisable to get on the defensive;
also, we must let the men know what seems likely to happen. Have the
town patrol keep their eyes on all men carrying rifles."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Report direct to me anything that appears of interest."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And, Sergeant&mdash;what about those fellows who arrived from Edmonton?"</p>

<p>"They were in a very bad state, sir. Of their party of fourteen they
were the only survivors. They wintered at Wind City, got scurvy, and all
died but four, and of the four these two only remain. The other two were
drowned in a rapid."</p>

<p>"Poor fellows! That will do, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Smoothbore was left to his recollections and general musings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gold, gold&mdash;the price that is paid for it! Fifty thousand men in this
stampede; two hundred and fifty thousand people affected; homes
devastated; affections torn asunder! Hundreds dead by scurvy or
drowning; thousands with constitutions wrecked! The gold is not worth
the candle, with the Trusts betrayed and morals twisted! It is not worth
it. Look at this little Yukon district, remote from the world. Our
genesis was of gold; it would seem our dissolution will be through the
same agent! The love of gold, that it may command luxury, is a source of
overwhelming evil: it feeds our vices&mdash;that is pretty well all that can
be said of this insensate greediness. But this is not practical!" he
continued, moving. "I must give orders that the men pay special
attention to their rifles and side-arms;" and he went off at once to the
orderly office. The time had come for every preparation to be made. The
Commandant considered the position.</p>

<p>There was no scope for fortifying the Barracks. The buildings were of
logs, loopholes could be made by the simple process of pushing a rifle
barrel through the mortar. The main thing was that the police should
appear to be unconscious of the movement on foot.</p>

<p>One action he determined upon, and that was the purchase of the best
rifles and ammunition in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> the shops: this to be accomplished by secret
agents. This was not entirely intended to keep arms from Berwick's men,
for the enemy would still have enough ammunition to exterminate the
police force. But the arms of the police were not "modern"!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE WOOD-PILE</h3>


<p>The Wood-pile was an institution almost as famous with the underworld as
Dawson itself. From St. Michael's to Frisco, and up and down the Yukon
River, its reputation held. At the mention of its name the pale and
sickly faces of the vicious became still paler and more sickly, when
they did not flush with angry hatred.</p>

<p>The Wood-pile was the prison, called so because the inmates, given hard
labour, worked out their debt to society by sawing wood. In cold
winter-weather&mdash;the winter of the sub-Arctic, with the thermometer forty
degrees below zero!&mdash;the process was no joke.</p>

<p>The great majority of the prisoners were United States citizens, in the
souls of whom many fourths of July had engendered a contempt for the
British uniform. To be herded by a yellow-leg with a rifle, and made to
saw wood to keep the oppressor warm, was a circumstance that rankled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Five Ace Dan&mdash;called, for brevity's sake, Five Ace&mdash;was on the
Wood-pile.</p>

<p>One day Five Ace was taking a hand in a Poker game, and by some
mischance one of the other players detected him extracting a card from
his sleeve, and charged him with the offence. There was, of course, a
row, whereupon Five Ace drew a revolver, and pointed it at his
adversary, with the words&mdash;adorned with some special expletives,</p>

<p>"If I had you across the line I'd fill you full of holes."</p>

<p>Whereat the man addressed came back with the words, uttered with a leer
and a hiss,</p>

<p>"But we ain't: See!"</p>

<p>Five Ace was surely in hard luck, for a policeman heard the noise of the
row, and quickly gathered him in. Smoothbore gave him three months on
the Wood-pile, with a blue ticket at the end of that term. A blue ticket
meant that the authorities requested the recipient to leave the
country&mdash;an invitation rarely not taken advantage of! But Five Ace was
serving his term in the summer months, when fuel was not a pressing
necessity, and the number of prisoners was large. The stock employment
of the gang was drawing gravel from the banks of the Yukon and carrying
it in barrows to the quadrangle of the Barracks, or the road-bed of the
main street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>While climatic conditions were infinitely better during the summer
months than they were in winter, this was not an unmixed blessing to
Five Ace; for while the winter months were dark and drear and cold, the
coldness, darkness, and dreariness, together with the abundance of
clothing it was necessary for the prisoners to wear, made it hard for
their persons to be recognized by passers-by. On the other hand, during
the bright summer days, the situation was very embarrassing; and it is
easy to believe that any one holding strong ideas on the rights of man,
a true citizen, that is to say, of the United States, so imprisoned, was
ready for any desperate venture. If it came to the killing of a
yellow-leg or two&mdash;what matter? There were no greater or more glorious
people on God's green earth than the citizens of the United States! Five
Ace was quite ready to pose as a hero and martyr, when opportunity
served.</p>

<p>Long Shorty happened to be a friend of Five Ace Dan; not that he
consorted with tin-horns, but Dan hadn't always been what he was now,
and, anyway, there wasn't much harm in pulling off a trick once in a
while! The officials in this country were always robbing people, so why
should not he put in a hand?</p>

<p>One day, as Long Shorty was prospecting for recruits, he recognized Five
Ace among the gang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> employed in the gravel pit, and, quick as a flash,
the idea came that it would be well to have an ally among the prisoners.
How to get into communication with Five Ace was a matter demanding
consideration; it would not do to make a mess of things through any
little mistake at the beginning. So he walked away, pondering, and sat
down and reviewed the situation from afar; in other words, he watched
the prisoners and noted their movements. There were about eight in this
particular band, over whom stood a policeman. The process was for the
prisoners to file down to the shore of the river, fill their barrows,
and march back again. Each man returned to the spot he had left and
picked up the tools he had been working with.</p>

<p>The best means to get a word with Five Ace was by means of a note,
provided the note did not fall into the hands of the police! Long Shorty
soon came to his decision. The note must not be compromising. This is
what Long Shorty wrote,</p>

<p>"The Marmot has generally two entrances to his burrow, the yellow-leg
has only one. Some day soon something is going to happen, but in the
meantime the hunters with rifles would like to know if the yellow-legs
are wise to the game. Where the seed is sown there will the flower grow,
and I expect response to this where I sow it; at dinner-hour I will look
for it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>After setting down this on a piece of paper, Long Shorty, not a little
proud of his achievement, rumpled it up with another piece of blank
paper and enclosed a small piece of lead pencil. This was because
prisoners were not always allowed paper and pencil.</p>

<p>After the little parcel was ready Long Shorty walked down-stream to
where there was a canoe belonging to a man he knew. He borrowed the
craft and began poling up-stream towards the mouth of the Klondike.</p>

<p>He had noted that the site of Five Ace's labour was very near the river,
so that when he passed the spot he could have stepped on the tools with
which the convict worked.</p>

<p>A labourer toiling with pick and shovel first loosens the soil with the
pick and then uses the shovel. The astute mind of Long Shorty conceived
that if he dropped the paper close to where the hand of the toiler, as
he grasped the shovel, would be, events would work out&mdash;as they did.</p>

<p>Five Ace, on returning with the empty barrow, took up his pick and began
to work, and while he was scratching the ground in the leisurely manner
of the convict his eye saw the paper. He judged that its appearance was
possibly connected with Long Shorty, who was hanging about watching. So,
with the slyness proper to his fraternity, he took up the shovel and
managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> smuggle and hide away the parcel by slipping it down his
neck.</p>

<p>When Five Ace had an opportunity he read the missive, and his breast
swelled. Here was evidently an invitation for him to join a rising
against the oppressors! If successful it would mean that an honest
fellow could shoot down a black-leg and get away. Judge Lynch would sit
in the Yukon. By all means things must be kept quiet. Five Ace felt sure
he could get the other prisoners to turn against their guard when the
proper time came. One man might get shot; but if he were careful it need
not be himself.</p>

<p>Long Shorty had the idea that Five Ace Dan and his fellow prisoners
might, in the case of a rising outside, carry out some portion of a
general move by striking a blow within. On the other hand, while Five
Ace believed he was the child of a race of patriots and felt himself a
champion of liberty with a possibility of shining before posterity, his
first and foremost idea was always his own liberty!</p>

<p>He wrote a note and left it as directed, where Long Shorty secured it,
and this is what it said,</p>

<p>"The Beaver is working with no thought of danger. If his dam is broken
in spots he will fix it. To drive him out you must make a clean job. You
have friends who will help, but you must keep them posted."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>Five Ace had evidently the same ideas as the leader of the insurrection,
that a sudden display of force, thousands strong, would make the
position at the Barracks untenable and force a surrender.</p>

<p>The following day Long Shorty replied,</p>

<p>"Many years ago the south face slid off the Dome and many ingins went to
the happy hunting-grounds. Some day something may slide off the Dome and
keep on going till it hits the Barracks and bumps it into the Klondike.
I will look out for things that are to happen, so that those in the
Barracks will know what to prepare for. In case they can help, I will
let them know."</p>

<p>All of which duly fell into the hands of Five Ace Dan, and conveyed to
him the true situation of affairs. Had it fallen into those of the
police it would have appeared as mere nonsense&mdash;the scribbling of some
prospector whose hardships had affected his reason. That is what Long
Shorty thought.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>A COUNCIL OF WAR</h3>


<p>Within a few days fifteen hundred men in Dawson had signified their
readiness to act for a new Government. Another thousand could readily be
counted upon from the creeks. Twenty-five hundred well-armed and
determined men, entrenched at the top of the Dome, could withstand an
army. To attack them, armed as they were with long-range sporting
rifles, would be, on the part of the police, madness.</p>

<p>It was noon on a Saturday when Long Shorty left his last note to Five
Ace Dan on the Yukon gravel bar. Having satisfied himself that the
missive had fallen into the proper hands, he set out for the Dome to
report. He found Berwick, Hugh Spencer, Bruce, Corte, and several others
holding a council of war. Berwick was giving instructions.</p>

<p>"Behind the Dome, you will notice, is a valley where the timber is
comparatively heavy. Our men can camp there with two weeks' provisions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Every man&mdash;or two men&mdash;will be their own commissariat. Their
instructions will be to hold themselves in readiness while recruits are
being gathered from the creeks."</p>

<p>"Recruits! We don't want no recruits from the creeks," roared Long
Shorty. "Fifteen hundred men will fix the thing."</p>

<p>Hugh agreed with this. "Fifteen hundred men should be able to scare less
than two hundred into surrender, especially when we can show them that
we can shoot and be out of range of their rifles." Berwick put the
matter to the vote, and it was agreed that the fifteen hundred to be
recruited from Dawson would be sufficient.</p>

<p>Berwick sighed. "Very good; fifteen hundred let it be; but we must try
to avoid bloodshed. This affair will be serious enough without anybody
being killed. Pass the word for a muster right away; camps to be made in
the woods as if a base for prospecting. At the camps rifles may be
cached to be quickly available. It is possible the police may not notice
the migration; but we must chance that. Until it is time to act the men
will go into town every day as usual."</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better have a preliminary muster?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Yes. It would serve a double purpose: give an opportunity to our men to
learn the plans; and the massing of so many upon the Dome would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
doubtless lead to inquiries by the police, and probably impress them
with our display of force. It is hardly possible they will make arrests,
and they can hardly shoot unarmed men."</p>

<p>"It won't do 'em any harm to show we look like meaning business. Why not
have the boys bring their arms?" asked Long Shorty.</p>

<p>"I'd say nothing about arms," Hugh counselled. "Let each man suit
himself; there'll be enough guns in the crowd to guard against
accidents."</p>

<p>"And what are we to do after our display of force?" asked Long Shorty.</p>

<p>"Send a letter to the Barracks, calling on the officer commanding to
surrender," answered John Berwick.</p>

<p>"If he does not surrender? Suppose he tells you to go to the devil?"</p>

<p>"We'll give him till Saturday to consider it."</p>

<p>"And then, if he says no?"</p>

<p>"He won't say no: he is a humane man, and must know we are in the right.
He must also be aware that we can annihilate him."</p>

<p>Berwick did not quite possess the assurance he showed in this reply.
There might be such a thing as Smoothbore being willing to die at his
post. Of late this idea had been more and more gaining hold on his mind;
his sleep had become more restless as the time for action approached. In
all probability some irrespon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>sible person would make a slip, which
would precipitate matters.</p>

<p>Dark thoughts and doubts came upon him, as they must at times to every
leader who holds under his control many lives; but resolutely he put
them from him, and comforted his heart, strengthened his determination,
by remembering the wrongs they had suffered and the righteousness of
their cause. He hoped earnestly that Smoothbore would recognize that his
force was outnumbered by at least ten to one.</p>

<p>But Long Shorty was tenacious; possibly he thought he detected some
wavering in his leader. And so he persisted,</p>

<p>"But if he does call the bluff?"</p>

<p>"In that case we must hold a council of war, and determine what to do.
Our display of force on Wednesday should make him apprehensive. By
Friday our intentions and strength must have impressed him. Then we
shall forward him a summons to surrender! If by Saturday noon he has not
complied...."</p>

<p>"We'll drop a few bullets round the flag-pole," cried Long Shorty; "and
it would not do much harm if we peppered a yellow-leg or two."</p>

<p>"I'd rather they got one of the grafters!" said a recruit, to which
remark others chorused, "Hear! hear!"</p>

<p>"We'll see&mdash;we'll see! What we need first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> is to get our forces camped
in the woods. So pass the word among our adherents that they are
expected to gain their encampment during Monday and Tuesday. Let Sunday
be a day of rest; it is possible the Sunday after may be far from
peaceful!"</p>

<p>"All right, boss," spoke up Frank. Frank was far more loyal to "Parson
Jack," much less inclined to question him, than Long Shorty.</p>

<p>"That ends this present business," said John. "Those of you who don't
wish to go into town may as well stay and go over the ground in survey
of a line of entrenchment."</p>

<p>Thereupon, with his friends about him, John went to his den and secured
a pick and shovel hidden there, and with them traced a furrow, to be
enlarged later. The riflemen would lie there and fire upon the Barracks.
To this day that furrow is to be found across the top of the Dome.</p>

<p>Dawson was now at the zenith of its prosperity. Not only had the creeks
produced many millions, but vast sums of outside capital were being paid
for speculative claims, as well as for properties of proven worth. For
those who were prosperous it was a heyday of delight; to those whose
fortunes had stuck it was no heyday. It was for these that Berwick and
his comrades were working: to give honest workers something of a fair
chance; though there was a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> span between the idealism of John and
the motives of Long Shorty, which were not a little selfish and sordid.</p>

<p>There have been many popular outbursts in the world's history; but never
had a leader entered his fortunes against an established Government with
the chances of success held by Berwick! In numbers, in arms and
equipment, he had the advantage. His hesitation was, therefore, not due
to any shirking of the issue. He was the reverse of a moral coward; and
yet he felt keenly the responsibility and unpleasantness of the part he
had to play in leading a force against the authority of Britain's Queen.
It was duty which drove him against his patriotic instincts. He loathed
the necessity; but there was no alternative if wrongs were to be
righted.</p>

<p>The five colleagues had been thoughtfully watching Dawson, that hive of
human bees.</p>

<p>The first to break the silence was Long Shorty, when he told of his
acquaintanceship with Five Ace Dan on the Wood-pile, and added the
suggestion that he might prove useful. This roused Hugh, who said
sharply, "We don't want any jail-birds!"</p>

<p>"He's a bit of a tin-horn," protested Shorty, "but he ain't a
jail-bird."</p>

<p>"There ain't much difference," was Hugh's retort. Long Shorty held his
peace.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>STONY GROUND</h3>


<p>Constable Hope had no doubts. Professional instinct told him there was
an important conspiracy hatching. He was ambitious, and he loved his
work, so that every impulse prompted him to find and follow the threads
of the plot. Smoothbore's action in keeping "tab"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> on the number of
men carrying rifles suggested to him that his Commandant regarded the
situation as serious.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Watch.</p></div>

<p>Therefore, beyond his orders&mdash;which were sufficient in themselves to
work off an ordinary policeman's superfluous energy&mdash;Hope worked
overtime. He discovered that George, Hugh, and Frank occupied the
home-ranch once more, and were extremely busy. He reasoned that if a
man's business be legitimate, it is easy to learn its nature. As the
business of these men was not quite evident, he determined to find out
what it was. So that on the morning of the meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> at the Dome Hope had
made his way there also, by a detour to the east. His route was the
longer, and the sun was hot. Also the trail he took led through some
patches of swamp, which meant mosquitoes.</p>

<p>When he reached the nearest point to the Dome, where he could remain
under cover of the bush, he was still out of earshot. He watched those
who came in view, but because the council had been seated in a circle
about the summit, after the manner of the Indian pow-wow, and he was
below the level of that summit, he could see only some of those who had
attended.</p>

<p>After the meeting had dissolved, and those remaining had plotted out
their entrenchments and started to return to Dawson, Hope made bold to
follow them. He drew back in time to avoid discovery from the five who
still were gazing thoughtfully upon the town; but he happened to hear
the reference to Five Ace Dan and the Wood-pile.</p>

<p>"They're camped on our trail. Five Ace would hardly be in demand for a
prayer meeting," thought the guardian of the peace, as eventually he
returned to the Police Barracks. He at once reported to Sergeant
Galbraith.</p>

<p>"The big Tyee<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> held a council of war on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> the summit at noon to-day.
These fellows are sure up to something."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Chinook for Chief.</p></div>

<p>"Hear anything?"</p>

<p>"No; could not get near enough, except at the last, when the big Yankee
said something about Five Ace Dan."</p>

<p>"Who's he?" asked Galbraith.</p>

<p>"The tin-horn on the Wood-pile for pulling a gun. Well, the Yankee said
something about his helping their cause or something; and the one they
call Hugh said he had no use for tin-horns. It looks as if the Yankee
might be in communication inside the Barracks."</p>

<p>"Well, he wouldn't learn much."</p>

<p>"He might tell them how poor are our arms."</p>

<p>"They know that already," Galbraith snorted.</p>

<p>"And how weak our guard is."</p>

<p>"They know that, too. That's the reason of this insurrection, or one of
the reasons. But what has a reference to Five Ace Dan got to do with
this plot that is supposed to be going on?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I guess. Probably nothing!"</p>

<p>"Well, the only thing you have to report is, that there was a pow-wow on
the Dome this morning."</p>

<p>"I guess so."</p>

<p>"But whether they were planning to put us all out of business, or
organizing an expedition to the North Pole&mdash;you don't know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Well, keep your eye on them, but don't report again until your report
is calculated to make a noise."</p>

<p>Constable Hope, not a little discouraged by the way his report was
received, sauntered out and drifted towards the Borealis. The seeds of
his efforts had fallen on stony ground.</p>

<p>But after he was gone Sergeant Galbraith expanded his chest, drew up to
the full extent of his six feet, and gazed through the door of his
office at the muskeg, which did duty for a street.</p>

<p>"Another council at the top of the Dome," he said to himself. He stood a
minute, stroked his moustache; then, his mind made up, strode out of the
office, and in due course was in the presence of his Commanding Officer.</p>

<p>"Another council at the Dome, sir," he reported.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Seems serious, sir, when men climb 1,800 feet, this hot weather, that
they may talk in private."</p>

<p>"Any other signs, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"It's the other signs that make it look serious. The number of men
carrying rifles is increasing rapidly. Yesterday no less than three
hundred rifles were seen in the streets."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you question any of those carrying them?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Had no orders, sir."</p>

<p>"Just so: it would not have done any good, and it might have done harm.
And you have had all supplies bought up, arms and ammunition?"</p>

<p>"All that were better than our own, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, have them secretly brought to the men's quarters, and let each
man have his pick. Then some of the best shots can have a day off to
practise a bit."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Something is going to happen soon," said Smoothbore to Herbert, who
during the interview had come in.</p>

<p>"Rather suggestive of Micawber that, if you will pardon my saying so,"
Herbert ventured to assert. He had been a sudden and complete convert to
the theory that trouble was brewing. The inaction of his Chief had been
getting on his nerves.</p>

<p>"Micawber had the great virtue of patience," answered Smoothbore with a
smile.</p>

<p>"I would arrest the leaders, sir, on a trumped-up charge, and get the
evidence out of them that way."</p>

<p>"That would be a mistake, my dear Herbert."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, sir; but here they can shoot us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> down like rats. If we have
to die, we had better die like men."</p>

<p>"If something does not turn up&mdash;as, you remind me, Micawber might have
said&mdash;you will have sufficient opportunity to die."</p>

<p>"I should wish to sell my life pretty dearly sir!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you won't have to sell it at all&mdash;if the something happens that
I expect."</p>

<p>"What do you expect, sir, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Just something," and Smoothbore smiled again. After a pause he
continued, "By all the laws of military and political science the
British Empire should have been wrecked ages ago. But something always
has happened. To arrest the leaders of this conspiracy would, I am sure,
be an error. It would precipitate matters, and undoubtedly cause
bloodshed. You must remember it is not with redskins we are dealing.
Many of these fellows who are arraying themselves against us are
excellent shots, accustomed to rough life, and in every way calculated
to make good fighters in such a country as this. If they really take up
arms against us, there is nothing to do but fight&mdash;fight to the death,
sell our lives as dearly as possible, as you say. If they have no
intention of taking up arms&mdash;and it is not yet certain that they
will&mdash;we can suffer no harm by inaction."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>"We might buy the leaders."</p>

<p>"A man who would sell himself and his friends would not stay bought;
and, somehow, I do not feel that the integrity of the British Empire
should be maintained by purchasing her enemies."</p>

<p>"But then there are our lives!"</p>

<p>"Our lives don't figure in this proposition," and once again Smoothbore
smiled.</p>

<p>Herbert felt his Chief was trifling with him and with the situation, so
he rose from his chair, walked to the window, and looked out upon the
quadrangle. This movement hid the flush of annoyance that had come over
his face. He made an excuse, and found his way out of the office.</p>

<p>"If only I were in command here," he thought, "I'd clap these fellows on
the Wood-pile, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>After that point no well-defined line of action suggested itself to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Smoothbore continued writing his report to Ottawa, telling of
his suspicions, and explaining his action, or want of action. He
intended to hold back the communication until the last moment&mdash;until he
was satisfied that "something would not turn up," which would certainly
be close to the crisis. Then he would confide it to a trusty scout and
send to the "outside." While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> he was writing his mind constantly played
with the facts of his own position. It pleased him to compare it with
that of Gordon in Khartoum; with these differences, that, for him,
assistance was out of the question, and his enemies were not fanatical
and were Christian. His would be a soldier's death, if "something did
not turn up."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>ON THE SCENT</h3>


<p>After being snubbed by his Sergeant Constable Hope lost heart&mdash;for a
little while; but on the Sunday he was again working assiduously, with
little luck.</p>

<p>Accident and caution caused Berwick to keep out of the way of the
determined policeman.</p>

<p>Suddenly the idea of looking further into the possible connection of
Five Ace Dan with the conspirators occurred to Hope. So on the day
following his Sunday of ill-success he posted himself near the
prisoners. He could distinguish the person of Five Ace Dan, and watched
closely for any sign made to a possible confederate, but without result.
This was disappointing, for brooding during the night on what Long
Shorty had said, he brought himself to believe he was close to an
important clue. As his inspection of Five Ace Dan brought no help to him
he felt again discouraged, and became sullen and brooding. Then his
interest awoke again, for Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> Shorty had appeared upon the scene. The
constable was about to rise to his feet and abandon the enterprise when
he saw the new-comer. He hid himself again immediately.</p>

<p>He watched Long Shorty take a piece of paper out of his pocket and
write. The man laboured hard over the missive; he was evidently no
fluent scribe. The paper, after being finished and carefully read
through, was rolled into a ball.</p>

<p>At last, at stroke of noon, the prisoners filed back to the Barracks.
Long Shorty at once strolled over, with careful casualness, to the scene
of their labours, and, as before, dropped the paper beside the handle of
the Five Ace's shovel. At once he went eager as a bird to Dawson.</p>

<p>When the coast was quite clear Hope came from his cover and annexed the
letter. The policeman's spirits were very cock-a-whoop.</p>

<p>"The Eagle is very fond of Yellow-legs," he read in the awful scrawl,
"and in two days' time a great many Eagles will gather together about
the summit of the big mountain, where they may watch the Yellow-legs;
and if the Yellow-legs don't come and make peace within two days, then
at the end of one more day the Eagles will descend upon the Yellow-legs
and make a meal of them. Any little dicky-birds found among the
Yellow-legs may go the same way, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> they make a move for liberty.
The Eagle loves liberty."</p>

<p>Constable Hope pondered over these words, and after copying them into
his notebook replaced the original where he had found it. He then made
his way to his Sergeant and the mid-day meal. No sooner, however, had he
come to Galbraith than he changed his mind. He would carry his news to
the Commandant himself, and not waste it on this discouraging minor
light.</p>

<p>"You're somewhat glum. Seen a ghost?" asked the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant, no!"</p>

<p>"Been drinking the wrong kind of hootch, I guess!"</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant, no!"</p>

<p>The first thing Hope did after lunch was to search the cell occupied by
Five Ace Dan. There he found, stuffed between the logs which comprised
one wall of the cell, the first missive written by Long Shorty. He
searched but could discover nothing else, but that would do. Off he went
to the Commandant.</p>

<p>"I have discovered something, sir, which I have thought sufficiently
important to bring direct to you."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"One of the men I am watching is communicating with a prisoner&mdash;Five Ace
Dan. I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> him mention the name on the Dome, on Saturday. To-day I
followed up the clue and intercepted a note."</p>

<p>Constable Hope took out his notebook. He was a bit nervous and excited.
He knew he was running a risk by not reporting, according to
regulations, by way of the Sergeant. Smoothbore was eyeing him intently.</p>

<p>Constable Hope handed the letter found in the cell, and his notebook
containing the copy of the missive left that morning, to the Commandant,
who read them with stern eyes.</p>

<p>"You think these are not the idle words of some partially demented
prospector?"</p>

<p>"I do not, sir. The big Yankee has nothing about him to indicate he has
lost his wits."</p>

<p>"So you think this is right, that there will be a massing of forces
about the Dome on Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir."</p>

<p>"And if there is a display of force on Wednesday, an attack will be made
on Friday?"</p>

<p>"On Saturday, sir."</p>

<p>"On Saturday; then if we see a massing of forces on Wednesday we may
expect trouble by Saturday?"</p>

<p>"That is my idea, sir."</p>

<p>"What have you done with the original of the note you found to-day?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put it where I found it, sir."</p>

<p>"And what do you intend doing with the one you found in the prisoner's
cell?"</p>

<p>"I had thought to replace it, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good; we can see if to-day's note is hidden in the same place
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Constable Hope was a proud man as he strode along the bank of the Yukon
to the town. He had ventured much, and won. Visions of himself holding a
commission passed through his mind. The possibility seemed more tangible
now. Whom should he meet but the Sergeant?</p>

<p>"Well, young fellow, been hunting for more noiseless reports?"</p>

<p>"I've been keeping my eyes open."</p>

<p>"Seen anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much to trouble you with, Sergeant."</p>

<p>"Well, I've seen something I couldn't help but see. A stampede seems to
have set in to the top of the Dome. Scores of fellows have been climbing
up there, packs on their backs. You had better join the crowd."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea."</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes Constable Hope had reached the Town Station, and made
a roll of some blankets, in which he stowed several tins of bully beef
and some biscuits. He was just setting out when his Sergeant arrived.</p>

<p>"Are not you going to take a rifle?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of doing so."</p>

<p>"You'd better: all the others have rifles."</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me."</p>

<p>"Then I tell you now. No&mdash;not the police rifle," as Hope picked up a
carbine. "Take this sporting rifle. Don't let 'em see you are a
policeman, and use your wits!"</p>

<p>Hope strapped on his bundle&mdash;it weighed full sixty pounds&mdash;and with a
"Good-bye, kid," from his Sergeant was off.</p>

<p>He made a detour far up the Klondike to gain a more gradual ascent, and
on the way did a powerful lot of thinking. The fact that many men were
climbing the Dome was some foundation for the idea that a gathering was
to take place there on Wednesday. He sat down to rest on the flat, or,
as it was called in the diggings, bench, half-way up the Klondike
bluffs. There was ample time, for it was still the season of perpetual
light; and if he awaited some other pilgrim would certainly come along,
from whom he might find out something. Sure enough a recruit to the
forces of the rebellion came into sight before five minutes had passed.
The man was heavily laden and struggling up the steep ascent. He clawed
at the brush in his efforts to pull himself up; and when finally he
succeeded flung himself down by the side of the policeman, his face
streaming with perspiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"A fellow will need a fat job when things get righted to pay for this!"</p>

<p>"He sure will," said Hope.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for a job collecting gold-dust."</p>

<p>"But there won't be any royalty then."</p>

<p>"That's right; that's right," and a thoughtful look came into the man's
eye. "I was promised a job&mdash;I wonder what kind of a job I can get? I
really had made up my mind to hold out for a job collecting. It must be
an all-fired good job if a fellow reckons on the dust these fellows who
hold it now blow in on the girls and wine. One year would be enough for
me: I'd save, and quit the country."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you'd save?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, I'm sure&mdash;at least I think I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Now don't you think if you were given the job of collecting royalty,
that you might feel tempted to go to a restaurant, order a steak with
chechacho potatoes,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and buy a bottle of wine to round things off?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Fresh potatoes as distinguished from evaporated potatoes.</p></div>

<p>The man gazed into vacancy a bit, and then looked Hope in the eye, and
slapped his knee, as he said,</p>

<p>"Do you know, partner, I think I might&mdash;if I get any boodle out of this
thing that's coming off, I think I will. Beefsteak! Beefsteak and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
onions!&mdash;and chechacho potatoes! Gosh! what a lay-out of them I could
eat right now. Beans&mdash;beans&mdash;bacon and beans&mdash;and then beans and bacon!
What a hell of a lot a fellow misses in this here country!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm afraid we will not be able to take our appetites with us."</p>

<p>"Say! I wonder what John D. Rockefeller would give for my appetite and
my stomach! Say! I bet he'd give a million cold cash. I bet he'd give a
million and a half&mdash;enough to buy the best claim on Eldorado."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps; but never mind, there's a good time coming for us."
Constable Hope did not wish the conversation to merge too much upon the
abstract.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in one week more&mdash;then we will have a chance to do some grafting.
And I tell you I can do with some; yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"You mean it will be all over in two weeks? As I understand it, there is
to be something doing on Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Only a line up, as I understand it; then on Friday the boss sends them
word to quit, giving them twenty-four hours to make up their minds
whether they will go to Heaven or down the River."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess that's the programme," said the policeman, successfully
hiding the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> that made his pulses throb. He felt this was
the official plan, as it coincided so well with the terms of the letter
now again folded in its place in the cell of Five Ace Dan.</p>

<p>Had Hope been without orders, he would have made an excuse, and posted
back to town right away. But his Sergeant had told him to masquerade
among the rebels; and he must obey orders.</p>

<p>So he resumed the upward march with the remark, "Well, pard, I guess we
had better hit the trail," whereupon the pard, with the accompaniment of
numerous oaths and grunts and sighs, struggled to his feet and onward up
the hill.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>AN ODIOUS DILEMMA</h3>


<p>Smoothbore was in possession of the facts Constable Hope had been able
to gather, which were, indeed, very little less than the complete plot.
Fifteen hundred men were camped in the bushes at the back of the Dome,
with enough bullets to kill the Standing Army of the British Empire; and
he had available a few more than one hundred men! True, they were good
men; but so were most of those on the other side. The trouble was that
both parties were right. It was for him and his men to subdue this
rebellion because it threatened the integrity and honour of the Empire.
At the same time the "insurrectoes" were demanding simple justice. It
was an odious dilemma.</p>

<p>In his mind's eye he pictured the vast spaces that stretched between the
Klondike and the "outside." They could hardly seem farther away from
help if the Klondike were on the planet Mars. Well, he would not
surrender;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> it would be better to die. The Yukon was sweeping along but
a stone's throw from the gate of the Barracks; in eight or ten hours its
rapid course would carry them into the United States. That might be a
resource of security to his men, if they were beaten, but for himself he
would fill a grave in that region of eternal frost.</p>

<p>It was Tuesday evening, the sun was sinking in the north, Heaven's vault
was finely painted in pink. The abrupt cliff on the west of the Yukon
threw a deep shadow across the mighty river, whose stately flood had
long held sovereignty in that weird land of dreams. The light from the
clouds above struggled against the shadows in the river, and was blended
with them. It was certainly majestic, magnificent!</p>

<p>The Commandant, as he walked up and down his office, often paused to
gaze upon the familiar scene.</p>

<p>A knock on the door caused him to start round. It was Herbert.</p>

<p>"I came to inquire, sir, for any fresh news on the situation."</p>

<p>"The news is, Herbert, that we may as well prepare to die a soldier's
death. There is to be a display of force to-morrow, and mobilization on
Friday, when a request to surrender will be sent in. Hostilities will
open on Saturday."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"What will be their demands?"</p>

<p>"That the police and all Government officials quit the country; in other
words, 'go down the river.'"</p>

<p>"And you will not comply?"</p>

<p>"I will not comply."</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but to fight to the last drop of blood."</p>

<p>"And the ultimate result?"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, we shall have upheld the prestige of the British uniform."
There was a pause. Both men were very thoughtful. The Commandant then
asked, "You remember Child?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He followed orders. He rode to death, because his orders were to
arrest, not to shoot: he did not flinch before the levelled rifle. What
he did as an individual the hundred and fifty of us can do."</p>

<p>"But we shall shoot!"</p>

<p>"We shall! While a cartridge remains and a finger has strength to pull a
trigger!"</p>

<p>Herbert looked glum: he was not a coward, but he thought his Chief's
policy was all wrong, and he was to give up his life&mdash;or die in
ignominy. It made him bitter&mdash;and then his mind travelled across the
great stretch of glacier, mountain, and plain, to his little cottage on
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> Prairie: it was not cowardice that brought the moisture to his
eyes!</p>

<p>"Damn it all, sir, it's hard to die here like a rat in a trap," Herbert
cried. He did not share his Chief's idealism. "Promise to force the
Commissioner to bring some sort of order out of chaos and clear out the
Gold Commissioner's office."</p>

<p>Smoothbore knew of the cottage and the little girl with golden curls who
was all the world to the inspector; so he understood the emotion of the
other and felt sympathy.</p>

<p>"Reform!&mdash;a promise of reform at this stage of the game would be no
good. The leader of this movement is an idealist, a fanatic, and
three-quarters of his followers&mdash;luck having been against them&mdash;hope to
restore their fortunes by the experiment of a new Government. The
situation is not dissimilar to that in the Thirteen Colonies at the
Revolution: a leader of parts, of education, imbued with theories on the
rights of man, at the head of a mob thirsting for the lands and jobs of
the Loyalists! Why has Alaska a population? Because the Sheriff back
East could not shoot straight.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Why had America a population before
the Revolution? Because there were not prisons enough in Europe. In
fact, the situation in the Klondike to-day is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> the same as it was
in America before the Revolution&mdash;only perhaps there is more justice on
the side of these, our enemies, than there was on the side of the
Yankees. The Government of George III taxed tea&mdash;which was then much
more of a luxury than it is to-day: our Government taxes the one product
of our people."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> A common saying in the North.</p></div>

<p>It was a long speech for the Commandant, but he knew what he was talking
about. Herbert sighed.</p>

<p>"Any special orders, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. The men have been given their new arms, and the situation is pretty
well understood among them."</p>

<p>"They are in fine fettle, sir, and spirit?"</p>

<p>"Good! If, as I expect, hostilities open, and things look hopeless, I
shall give every man the opportunity of passing out and down the river,
and this will include officers&mdash;but as for surrender, I won't."</p>

<p>Herbert, about to make his adieu, turned towards the door, when the
Chief remarked,</p>

<p>"It appears a prisoner, known as Five Ace Dan, has been receiving
communications from one of the leaders of the rising. I have given
orders that a double guard be put on these men, and special sentries, to
see that no word passes among them. You will see that those orders are
carried out."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; good-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Herbert."</p>

<p>Smoothbore gazed at the river once again. It swung on its majestic
course, but the rose tints were gone; only the dark shadows of the hill
remained. The hour seemed ominous.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>A DERELICT</h3>


<p>Surgeon-Major Peel was strongly imbued with the instincts of humanity,
but, like many professional men, his business acumen was small. While
one or two of his patients were prosperous claim-owners who could afford
to pay an ounce and a half of gold-dust per day, there were many who
passed into his care who could not pay, and these, the poorly nourished
and mentally depressed, were the more susceptible to attacks by the
deadly typhoid-bacillus.</p>

<p>Not that the patients were dishonest&mdash;they simply had not the money.
What could be done under the circumstances? The delirious victim who was
bundled up to the doors of St. George's could not be turned away!
Obviously it was the duty of the Government, reaping enormous revenues
from the whisky traffic and the gold royalty, to pay.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it was the Tuesday before the meeting on the Dome&mdash;a big hulk
of a man joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> patients of the St. George's Private Hospital. His
temperature was 104½, and he was delirious. A neighbour had brought him;
his name was unknown, his residence was given as the North End. It was
Long Shorty!</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," remarked the Surgeon-Major sympathetically, when he had
taken his pulse, had slipped the thermometer under his arm, and was
watching the gasping figure.</p>

<p>"Typhoid attacks even the strongest. What a handsome animal he would be
if his face showed less dissipation!"</p>

<p>"He does not look likely to prove a profitable guest," Alice commented.
She was the housekeeper of the establishment and found the domestic
problems more difficult than her father imagined.</p>

<p>"Who knows, who knows! He may have property which will turn out a
Bonanza; think of Gold Hill&mdash;ten English pounds to each shovelful of
dirt dug from the bed-rock, and the claim-owners round about were coming
to the two Swedes who owned the claim to ask them to work for wages!"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," said Alice, "but there's another side to these stories.
Think of the thousands in and around Dawson living on one meal a day; it
is always the same in every mining excitement. It is either too much
wealth, or nothing at all!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>She was evidently thinking of John, remembering his talk of experiences.
Her father, who, though blind to many of the aspects of life, was a keen
observer of his daughter, guessed at the truth.</p>

<p>"It is strange we can learn nothing of John," he said.</p>

<p>"He must be away on the creeks," she answered wistfully. "I have sent
several letters to him through the post; and it can't be that they all
would go astray."</p>

<p>The girl sighed, and her father busied himself anew with the work of the
hospital.</p>

<p>"Fred is to give this man a cold bath and put him in ward 'C.' I really
must see the Commissioner&mdash;Hi-u Bill, they call him&mdash;and come to some
understanding as to indigent patients."</p>

<p>For some reason, not apparent on the surface, Long Shorty made a great
impression upon Alice. She interested herself in his case, and often sat
by his bed. His fever remained high and persistent; he was still
delirious. Wild things he said. What most interested Alice was his
continuous references to "Parson Jack."</p>

<p>"Parson Jack, I knew he was no tenderfoot; a fellow what would mush
forty-five miles for a sick pal&mdash;Parson Jack&mdash;and then want to mush back
again. Parson Jack, Parson Jack&mdash;he gave Poo-Bah hell&mdash;hell on
toast!&mdash;Parson Jack!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> And the great muscles would stand out upon his
neck and arms as he waved his clenched fists in the air.</p>

<p>"Parson Jack" might mean any one, thought Alice.</p>

<p>The fever had run about a week of its course when Long Shorty entered
the hospital, so that the disease had another two weeks to run before
the crisis would be reached. There was nothing to do but wait patiently
for the return of consciousness. In the meantime, her imagination
pictured much. She tried, by suggestion, to shape the course of his
ravings, but found they were as fleeting and volatile as the changing
winds of the heavens.</p>

<p>The special services rendered by Alice to Long Shorty did not escape her
father's notice. He remarked to her one day,</p>

<p>"Alice, no one could accuse you of worldliness; you certainly are giving
the delirious patient in ward 'C' a full measure of attention!"</p>

<p>"Do you know, father," she then said frankly, "in some ways he reminds
me of John. I don't know how it is; I suppose they have something in
common, something may link them together. He is perpetually calling on
Parson Jack."</p>

<p>"Ha!" snorted her father. "Our patient is far from being of the type of
Berwick!"</p>

<p>Both of them hurried away to their work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>That same evening, hours after the day-staff had ceased their labours,
Alice was watching beside Long Shorty, and, notwithstanding its many
disagreeable passages, listened to his wild flow of language. He was
ever living over again his struggles with the forces of Nature, with his
fellows, and his own tempestuous passions!</p>

<p>"The blue water, the blue water, keep her to the blue!"&mdash;her patient was
again living a dash through a rapid in a canoe.&mdash;"White water means
rocks and death&mdash;death&mdash;death, I say! To the right!"&mdash;and he would
shout. In those anxious weary hours the girl grew to realize something
of the wild, rough life of the frontiersmen.</p>

<p>On the morning of the Friday when the ultimatum was to be sent to
Smoothbore, Peel returned to the hospital from the town. He was in a
condition of excitement, as was every one else in Dawson.</p>

<p>"Alice, that typhoid fellow was talking about Parson Jack?"</p>

<p>"He was," replied Alice, opening her eyes with expectancy. "Why do you
say that?"</p>

<p>"Because that's the chap who is trying to overthrow the Government. Our
patient may be one of the conspirators."</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Alice, and hastened away. She knew "Parson Jack" was
Berwick. Intui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>tion told her so. She was absolutely certain of the fact.</p>

<p>The news that a plot was brewing had, of course, penetrated the walls of
the hospital. Now that Alice knew John Berwick was concerned in it her
interest quickened and her anxieties awoke.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>TRIBUTE</h3>


<p>The demonstration of force, as organized by Berwick, had taken place
according to schedule. The display was plainly seen from the Barracks,
and its intent generally known throughout the town, wherein it became
the one topic of conversation. The dance-halls were but half patronized,
the gambling-tables seemed to have lost their popularity on that
Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Not that any fear was felt. The men of Dawson were generally not of the
fearing type. They were thirsty for news; their interest was so stirred
that they must let off steam by talking.</p>

<p>In the Borealis the woman nicknamed Roundeyes stood apart. Of all the
faces present hers alone showed apprehension, for she had a real regard
for Poo-Bah, the Prince of Grafters, whose domination at last was
threatened.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes lit up. A big hulk of a man came stumbling into the
place. Poo-Bah! Her face grew white as she ran up and caught his arm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"What&mdash;what will they do with you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I guess." He laughed in a rambling manner. "What do they want
me for?"</p>

<p>"Some fellow you have done up will take a shot at you now there is no
danger of the yellow-legs!"</p>

<p>Until the present crisis the prestige of the police had been so great
that the possibility of any one seeking and gratifying personal revenge
had never crossed Poo-Bah's mind. What would happen now? With all his
confidence the question asked by the girl would repeat itself. He knew
he was not popular. Many a man owed the wreck of his fortune to him, and
would enjoy a chance of shooting him. His hands clenched for a minute,
but he put the thought away. It was the spirit of the voyageur, the
custom of the country, to brush aside the disagreeable. The thought of
death and of what may come after death was resolutely set aside.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell! Come and have a drink." So he endeavoured to disperse his own
and the woman's fears. She was not so easily satisfied. She caught him
again by the arm, bowed her head against his shoulder, and sobbed,</p>

<p>"Oh, my baby! my baby! Somebody will blow daylight through you!"</p>

<p>Poo-Bah drew his arm roughly from her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> the single word "Quit!" and
strode towards a curtained recess, Roundeyes meekly following. In a
minute or two a champagne bottle popped, and there was laughter,
expressing the wild spirits of the underworld.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the Dome, John Berwick paced up and down, a prey to
conflicting motives. He was now full in the vortex of civil strife; a
few short days and hostilities in all probability would open. He had no
doubts now as to the spirit to be shown by the Police Commandant.</p>

<p>On Point Lookout sat Constable Hope, with his face towards the Upper
Yukon. To the left he could see the Klondike Valley; to the right were
the Police Barracks, with Dawson beyond them. His back was to the Dome.
He sat still; a project was in his mind; he was thinking hard.</p>

<p>At the same time Smoothbore was in his office with Hi-u Bill, the
Commissioner, and Inspector Herbert. Sergeant Galbraith stood at
attention before them.</p>

<p>"You have ordered your men to be in readiness to fall back upon the
Barracks. The orders for additional commissariat are placed with the
different companies? The men, I suppose, pretty well understand what is
in the wind?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Galbraith answered to every question.</p>

<p>"And the men are in good spirits?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have told them, sir, you intend to fight."</p>

<p>"And how do they seem to take it?"</p>

<p>"One of the fellows said he'd go to hell for you, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, that would seem satisfactory." The Commandant smiled grimly. "Our
best hope is dissension among the rebels, and I have no idea how that
may be brought about. That will do, Sergeant."</p>

<p>After the policeman had left there was silence for some time, which was
at last broken by Hi-u Bill.</p>

<p>"I don't fancy they will do anything to me, and as I'm not called upon
to fight I'm out of it. I am&mdash;and I suppose I may say it in modesty&mdash;a
bit of a shot; but one has others to consider as well as himself."</p>

<p>The Commissioner was in the habit of spending his afternoons at target
practice, which was not altogether appreciated by those whose business
with him was pressing.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are altogether too modest; you know you're a famous
shot."</p>

<p>Under usual circumstances Hi-u Bill was quite ready to receive
compliments on his shooting, but the present circumstances were
extraordinary, and he was undoubtedly perturbed. But the Commandant was
merciless, for he continued,</p>

<p>"Of course, I am letting it be understood that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> I shall welcome all
volunteers who desire to lend their aid at the present crisis."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; no doubt there will be many who will avail themselves of the
opportunity." Hi-u Bill was not over enthusiastic as he said this.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I think I could make my friends fairly comfortable under the
circumstances."</p>

<p>"Certainly, quite so. My cabin at the North End is quite comfortable,
and so close under the Dome that they could not shoot at me unless they
came half-way down, in which case they would expose themselves to your
fire. Capital idea that of yours, securing the long range sporting
rifles. I almost feel sorry that I could not be with you here, as well
as at my cabin, just to try a shot or two; but you see I think I had
better stay outside. I have many friends among the old-timers, and
nobody has ever accused me of doing anything serious. I certainly am not
rich on ill-gotten gains." Hi-u Bill rubbed his hands nervously and cast
a look at the Dome.</p>

<p>"Of course if you feel"&mdash;Smoothbore was choosing his words&mdash;"there is
fear of any of the unsuccessful attributing their failure to you and
wreaking vengeance on you I shall be quite happy to give you our
protection."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no. I prefer to run my chances outside; really I do."</p>

<p>Herbert, who was distressed equally at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> irony of his Chief and the
determined density of the Commissioner, diverted the conversation to
another channel.</p>

<p>"In case of a siege, sir, there will be the question of water supply."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have thought of that. We shall have a supply from the river
before hostilities break out, and after that a well may be sunk in
twenty-four hours; the earth is not frozen here. But then if something
turns up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Something turns up!" ejaculated Hi-u Bill, almost rising from his seat.
"What could turn up? It would take an army eighteen months to get here
across country, even by the Stikeen route; it will be close upon winter
by the time news of this reaches Ottawa, and by the earliest time a
force could be fitted out the Passes would be oceans deep in snow."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;there's the luck of the British Empire!" There was a quiet
smile on Smoothbore's lips. "Something always has turned up to save the
British&mdash;except, except in the case of Gordon. That was the exception to
the rule."</p>

<p>There was a sharp knock at the door, and the "Come in" was answered by
Constable Hope&mdash;his face flushed. He was evidently very excited. The
idea&mdash;on which for long he had been brooding&mdash;had come to maturity!</p>

<p>"I have a plan, sir, which will save us, I think.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> To carry it out I
shall require gold, within limits, but the more the better."</p>

<p>Gold! The Commandant should have large quantities, the proceeds of
royalty collections. Hi-u Bill pricked up his ears, bethought him of the
fact, and asked directly,</p>

<p>"What have you done with all your gold?"</p>

<p>"I've had it buried. The plan of the exact spot will reach the
authorities if we go under. But Forty Mile royalty came in to-day and
has not yet been buried. How much do you want?" he asked. Constable
Hope's heart gave a great leap as he realized he was going to be
trusted.</p>

<p>"At least twenty thousand dollars, sir. Down River gold will do."</p>

<p>"Your plan will take that much?"</p>

<p>"I shall need that much, sir, but shall return it all, or nearly all."</p>

<p>"Very good, here it is." With the words the Commandant took a bag of
gold out of a rough chest and handed it to the policeman.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, Hope."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." With the best salute he was master of the youth left
the office.</p>

<p>Hi-u Bill had both eyes wide open, staring at Smoothbore. "What the
devil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is just a tribute to the gods; I may not bribe our enemies, but
the fates&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"A bag of gold you can hardly lift! Why, your man will go down the River
and stay down. You know the Yanks would afford him every protection,
seeing that he stole from our Government."</p>

<p>"He won't steal the gold," replied Smoothbore.</p>

<p>"He won't! How do you know he won't?"</p>

<p>"I know my men!"</p>

<p>An unusual thing had happened. For a private to ask his Commanding
Officer for the loan of twenty thousand dollars in gold, for that
Commanding Officer to entrust it to him for some unexpressed purpose was
strange&mdash;but many strange things happen on the frontier, and this was a
time of crisis.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>NO SURRENDER</h3>


<p>Berwick's muster had been fifteen hundred strong on the Friday at noon.
Of discipline there was little or none, and Berwick knew better than to
attempt to enforce any. They had chosen him as their leader, and up to
the present had not disputed his authority.</p>

<p>His directions were that the men should hold the Dome, retire to their
camps in the forest to cook their food, but be ever-ready promptly to
regain their position.</p>

<p>At noon he stood upon a boulder, and read to his followers the summons
to surrender he had dispatched to Smoothbore. To the present&mdash;nine
o'clock in the evening&mdash;no answer had been received, the summons to
surrender was being received with contempt. He felt the responsibility
upon him greater than ever; its weight increased as the time for the use
of force approached. The twenty-four hours' notice before striking had
nearly expired. He loathed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> prospect of taking life, and prayed that
the police would submit! If only they would see the hopelessness of
resistance and send a pacific answer! Would that answer never come?</p>

<p>As he sat in meditation Berwick observed a restlessness among some men
who were grouped, talking, gazing down the river. He looked in the same
direction, and noticed a column of smoke. Then the hulk of a river
steamer hove in sight. This visibly affected the men, who began to leave
their posts and scramble down the hill to the town.</p>

<p>The arrival of a steamer in Dawson in the summer of 1898 was a matter of
moment. An idea came to Berwick at the sight of her and the procession
of people hurrying to meet her. He would go to the town. Everybody there
would be keen to attend the docking of the steamer, making it
practically certain that his visit to the Barracks would not be noticed.
So to the Barracks he went.</p>

<p>"I wish to see the Officer commanding," he said to the sentry.</p>

<p>"Name?"</p>

<p>"John Berwick."</p>

<p>The man gulped, and stared at the visitor. He knocked at the door, and
announced,</p>

<p>"A man to see you, sir, by name of John Berwick."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Hi-u Bill was again in the office, had just read the ultimatum, the
discussion of which had been interrupted by the entrance of the man. He
opened his eyes wide at the mention of the rebel's name.</p>

<p>"Show him in!"</p>

<p>Had the usual happy accident come to pass? flashed through Smoothbore's
mind as he gazed with eyes of curiosity at the pseudo-President of the
Klondike Free State that was to be.</p>

<p>Berwick entered, and stood facing the two chief executive officers of
the Government. He at once picked out the Police Commandant, and
returned his gaze without flinching.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"I've come in the hopes of saving life. I have come to plead with you to
comply with our request and surrender to our forces."</p>

<p>Smoothbore was struck by the transparent candour of the man and his
quixotism. "British garrisons are not in the habit of surrendering at
the call of rebels," he answered stiffly.</p>

<p>The word "rebel" roused Berwick. It stung. "I do not come to you from
any cowardice, or through fear of death, or defeat. I come in the spirit
of humanity."</p>

<p>"A very worthy mission! Then why not disband your forces?"</p>

<p>Berwick brushed the suggestion aside. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> have ten men for every one of
yours, and my position commands these buildings. My men are in earnest,
and there is justice in our cause, even to warrant the shedding of
blood. This you must recognize."</p>

<p>"I recognize nothing but that I am here to uphold the law of the land."</p>

<p>"You must know&mdash;you must recognize&mdash;that great dishonesty exists within
the Civil Service, and that we have met to protest and put an end to
it!"</p>

<p>"Officially, I know nothing of that. It is my duty to maintain the Union
Jack flying in the land."</p>

<p>"We can fire your buildings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may be able to fire our buildings; you may be able to kill us all;
and then you may lower the flag. I tell you I intend to sink with my
ship. When you have burned us out, those men of mine&mdash;who wish to&mdash;may
take to the river. That is all. You have my answer."</p>

<p>Berwick's eyes filled; a lump was in his throat. He gulped, and with a
husky "Good-evening!" staggered into the open. He bent his head that the
sentry might not see his emotion, and so gained the street by the
Yukon's bank.</p>

<p>"He does not look much like a traitor," remarked Hi-u Bill.</p>

<p>"He is a man of evident ability. I fancy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> England, in other days, he
would have been a Whig. He has too little philosophy, or too much. Well,
Commissioner," he said to Hi-u Bill, "are you going to stay with me, or
run your chances in the town?"</p>

<p>"Me! I really think I'd better stay in my cabin. You see I am really not
in this, and there are a lot of papers and records I had better bury
somewhere."</p>

<p>On leaving the Barracks Berwick had been in somewhat of a daze. He was
still in that condition when he found himself at the dock. The steamer
<i>Susan</i> was tying to the wharf; the swift current had made docking
difficult, so that he was in time to witness the landing of the
passengers.</p>

<p>The crowd on the steamer was much as he had expected; but there was one
man coming down the gang-plank who attracted his attention, and that of
the onlookers generally; his hair fell to his shoulders; he had a great
beard; his clothes were covered with grease, and he was very dirty.</p>

<p>He had a small pack strapped to his back; it was a very small pack&mdash;not
much larger than a turnip; yet the figure that carried it bent under the
load.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>THE MAN WITH THE POUCH</h3>


<p>There were no signs of hesitancy in the movements of the man with the
small round burden. He entered the Borealis, advanced to the bar, upon
which he threw down the sack.</p>

<p>"Pass along your poison," said he to the bartender.</p>

<p>"What will it be?"</p>

<p>"What will it be! Why wine, what else would it be? Pass along a bottle."</p>

<p>"Large or small?"</p>

<p>"Large or small! Why large, of course! Say, son, what do you take me
for?"</p>

<p>The bottle of wine was opened, and the new-comer quenched a willing
thirst. He then turned to the crowd that had by this time clustered
round him.</p>

<p>"Come on and have a drink, boys," he said, waving the bottle. "Belly-up
to this good American timber." He jumped upon the bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> and drank again.
"Wine, wine! Give them wine, feed the nectar of the gods to the swine!
Make 'em happy for once."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the manner of the invitation, the crowd responded, and
soon the two bartenders were busy.</p>

<p>"Stack the empties there so I can see and count 'em; thirty dollars
per," and the host pointed to a shelf against the wall.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" shouted one of his guests.</p>

<p>He made no reply, but continued his tirade.</p>

<p>"Oh, you malamoots, you coyotes! You swine, descended of jackals! Drink,
damn you, drink&mdash;you who live in this neck of the woods, and lie down
and are robbed! no self-respecting jackal would own you for his sons.
You who call yourselves citizens of the great and glorious United
States! You're here rottin' in your cabins, the manhood squashed out of
you by the yellow-legs. Say! throw the booze into you, and then tell me
what I can call you to let you know how low down I think you."</p>

<p>"Say! partner," called another, "cut out all that and tell us where you
got the swag."</p>

<p>"You sundowners and larrikins! Do you not remember Hanson's reward? Why
don't you get in and dig?"</p>

<p>"Blow that, and tell us what's what&mdash;straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> wire." Kalgoorlie Charlie
also was feeling the effect of the liquor.</p>

<p>The man on the bar began to dance a hornpipe, while the crowd surged
excitedly around. The news had spread like wildfire through the dance
halls. "Some fellow from new diggings was blowing himself!" The Borealis
soon became crowded.</p>

<p>"Oh, you lily-livered gelatinous-vertibraed apologies for men!" cried
he. "What do you take me for? Me to go off into the bush for months and
rustle new diggings, and then tell a lot of perambulating carrion like
you where I struck it! Drink, and be damned to you! I don't care for a
little gold. I wouldn't mind letting you have a claim next to mine; the
claim I have will produce enough gold to make the Bank of England look
like the baby's savings-account! Do you think I would show a bunch of
Weary Willies like you where a month's work would make you all
millionaires? Come, have another drink, and get wise."</p>

<p>The speaker again put the mouth of his bottle to his lips; but a keen
observer would have noticed that his throat gave no movement to indicate
that the wine was passing to his stomach. This was noticed by Berwick
alone, who had followed the man with the big poke, but had stood just
inside the doorway. Berwick guessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> he was acting a part, and wondered
why. He watched.</p>

<p>There was a confused buzz of conversation.</p>

<p>"He must have struck the real stuff," remarked one.</p>

<p>"He sure has the goods," agreed another.</p>

<p>"This will make a hole in his poke," said a third.</p>

<p>"If what he says is anything near right, this ain't a pinch of snuff,"
was the comment of a fourth.</p>

<p>The man dancing on the bar stood waving his bottle, looking at the crowd
with a stupid stare, evidently awaiting inspiration, when a voice cried,</p>

<p>"Say! old cock, won't you let us have the news? We'll protect you in
discovery."</p>

<p>"Oh, you North American Chinamen, called Canadians, do you know what I
think of you? You English, you ain't no better than the others; do you
all know what I think of you?"</p>

<p>"You've told us straight enough&mdash;there's lot's of colour in your
bouquets; now tell us which way the new diggings is."</p>

<p>"There ain't no yellow-legs there."</p>

<p>Some one shouted, "There won't be any yellow-legs here after to-morrow,"
but the remark was lost in the general noise.</p>

<p>"It's in Alaskie&mdash;God's country," came a voice from the tumult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not say so."</p>

<p>"But it is, it is!"</p>

<p>"I don't say it ain't."</p>

<p>"It's in God's country&mdash;whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"That's what I ain't tellin'."</p>

<p>There was a clamour of inquiries. The new-comer, still holding his
bottle prominently, was the target of eager gaze.</p>

<p>"Up the Porcupine&mdash;the Tanana, or the Koyukuck?"</p>

<p>"You must think I'm easy!" He spoke with a leer.</p>

<p>"You've made your stake, why not tell us where to make ours? It's a law
of the frontier."</p>

<p>"So it is among pards. You ain't no pards of mine; I'm just standing you
a few drinks out of pity, finding my reward in tellin' you what I think
of you."</p>

<p>"You've told us what you think of us. Now tell us what we want to hear."</p>

<p>"Quite sure I've expressed myself strong enough?"</p>

<p>"Quite! Oh, quite!"&mdash;came from a dozen voices.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll tell you."</p>

<p>But he from the newly-found Eldorado stopped at the promise, and paused,
regarding his audience. A strange silence came over the erstwhile
struggling and swaying mass. The building was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> full, and the crowd
extended into the street, where there were hundreds more; and to this
great number additions were continually being made.</p>

<p>"Well, where is it?"</p>

<p>"It's on the south fork." The speaker put the bottle to his mouth once
more.</p>

<p>Groans and hisses broke from the crowd. "If you don't tell us after
keeping us here we'll string you up on a telegraph-pole."</p>

<p>"I did not keep you here: it was the free booze; besides, there ain't no
telegraph-poles in Dawson."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we'll chuck you into the river."</p>

<p>"I'll swim out: I'm strong on baths&mdash;though perhaps I don't look it!
Have another drink?"</p>

<p>"What we want now is a straight tip&mdash;and you had better give it."</p>

<p>"It's on the south fork of the north branch."</p>

<p>"The north branch of what?"</p>

<p>"I ain't tellin'."</p>

<p>"By God, you'd better! We ain't going to stand for more foolin'."</p>

<p>"You are all what I say you are&mdash;the scum of the earth."</p>

<p>"All right! We're anything you like: but let us have the news."</p>

<p>"It's the south fork of the north branch of the south fork&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you quitting for? why don't you spit it out of you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ain't I getting rid of it?"</p>

<p>"Not fast enough; quick, out with it!"</p>

<p>"Don't be impatient, sons, patience is a great virtue. It's taken me
nigh to fifty years' hard prospecting to make a strike&mdash;and you fellows
want me to tell you all about it in fifty minutes! How many minutes are
there in fifty years?"</p>

<p>"You old fool, you'd better quit playing with us."</p>

<p>"Who wants to play with you?"</p>

<p>"You're teasing us; now quit! What river is this where you found the
gold?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's the south fork of the north branch of the south fork of the
south branch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" interrupted one of the impatient ones.</p>

<p>"There now, just when I get going you fellows spoil it all. Remember, it
took fifty years almost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it will take you fifty years to tell us where you did find it."</p>

<p>"No, it won't; it's on the Fifty-Seven Mile River."</p>

<p>"The Fifty-Seven Mile River! The south fork of the north branch of the
south fork of the north branch of the Fifty-Seven Mile River!" A great
shout went up.</p>

<p>The Fifty-Seven Mile River emptied into the Yukon on the Canadian side,
but it "headed" in Alaska, where the diggings probably were.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> Within two
minutes the Borealis was practically empty.</p>

<p>Of the few remaining John Berwick was one. He stood with his back to the
wall, staring at the man who still stood on the bar, who returned the
stare. Meanwhile the host had turned to the row of bottles and begun the
counting. The number was sixty. "Sixty! eighteen hundred dollars, cheap
at double the money," said the man, who proceeded to weigh out the cost.
That done he stalked out of the saloon and rapidly went his way. There
was so much activity and excitement about that his progress to the
Barracks was uninterrupted. No sooner was he within the gate than he
tore off his beard and wig. It was Constable Hope.</p>

<p>Berwick had followed him from the saloon and watched him enter the
Barracks. He now realized all that it meant. A blow had been struck at
his organization. He realized that it was too late for any
counter-effort. Greed of gold had taken possession of the men. A new
rush was beginning. What call could reason, loyalty, righteousness make
against that?</p>

<p>He wandered to the water-front and watched the activity, for within half
an hour of the news of the supposed new strike being received boats had
begun to shoot out from the river bank, bearing adventurers to the new
diggings.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>AFTER THE CRISIS</h3>


<p>Mankind in Dawson having muddled its affairs, the gods took a hand in
the game.</p>

<p>John Berwick, as he turned his face homewards early on the following
day, happened to take the route that would carry him by the Barracks,
notwithstanding that it would add a mile to the journey. As he climbed
the hog's-back to Lookout Point he saw the tall military figure of
Smoothbore in front of him. The Commandant, seeing him coming, awaited
him.</p>

<p>"Good-morning. The air is very good."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed."</p>

<p>After this there was a pause. Evidently Smoothbore desired to make no
reference to the interview of the preceding day. Possibly he judged the
cause of the reformers to be already lost. If so Berwick would give him
every opportunity of keeping the conversation from politics: so he
continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"How pure the Klondike is and clear, and how beautiful are the shades
across the Yukon!"</p>

<p>"'And only man is vile,'" quoted the Commandant.</p>

<p>Berwick realized that the Head of the Police was poking fun at him; and
not knowing Smoothbore very well, concluded that he must know of the new
stampede; in fact, he seemed to be watching the dark specks of moving
men streaming over the summit of the Dome.</p>

<p>"Do you often walk abroad so early?" John asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is becoming a habit. One requires but little sleep in this
climate; I shall soon return, and go to work."</p>

<p>"Are your labours heavy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, heavy enough; there are many details."</p>

<p>"You have a splendid force, sir."</p>

<p>"I have, and they are loyal to me and their country."</p>

<p>"Loyalty is among the chief of human virtues. But is loyalty in all
cases a virtue?"</p>

<p>"I consider it so."</p>

<p>"Your men must find many duties distasteful to them."</p>

<p>"Duty is often distasteful, but it is never to be mistaken. With me it
is very well defined. Are you also taking a morning constitutional?"</p>

<p>"I am going up to the Dome." It would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> do for John to let the other
know the whereabouts of his abode or to divulge the fact that it was his
custom to sleep at night. It was a custom with many in that city of
perpetual light to sleep in the normal daytime and work at night.</p>

<p>"I'm going the same way. We'll walk together. I wish to spy out the land
a bit. We may decide to build a trail to Moosehide."</p>

<p>The two continued on the winding trail, which was now lined with human
habitations, set down without any idea of system. Some were cabins,
others tents, others still a combination of the two&mdash;such, indeed, as
was John's "home-ranch." Before many of them camp-fires were crackling
and burning, and meals were being prepared. The two who were or had been
the leaders of the opposing parties passed without attention being paid
to them.</p>

<p>"Ah! there's the danger signal, the result of the first frost, and a
sign that summer will soon pass away." John pointed to a willow whose
leaves had turned crimson and scarlet.</p>

<p>"Yes, we shall have winter soon; this weather won't last. But you are in
error in supposing that the bright tints in our foliage are due to
frost; the mistake is very common. The redness is mere ripeness."</p>

<p>They found many topics in common, and mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> interest made the stiff
effort less trying as they climbed and climbed.</p>

<p>As they approached a point on the trail, half way to the summit, a man
was seen coming down, dragging a log by a rope. They stepped aside from
the path, which here was on the side hill. Berwick, who was outside,
happened to place his foot on a loose lump of moss lying on a stone. It
moved; his foot slipped; he lost his balance. He struggled on the
shelving ground, grabbed at some grass, was tangled in some brush, tore
his hands, went down with a crash, being stopped by a sharpened stump of
a severed tree-trunk. The point grazed his arm and pierced the body
under the shoulder-blade. At once the Commandant and the woodman went to
his help, but the jar of attempting to raise him brought a cry of pain.
It was necessary to cut the tree-stump before he could be assisted to
his feet.</p>

<p>They had to carry him down the hill, his mind in a half-swoon punctuated
with throbs and stabs of pain, until he awoke to consciousness in the
St. George's Hospital.</p>

<p>It seemed more as the remembrance of a dream than of actual occurrence.
He was in England. Even the voice of Alice ...</p>

<p>A pungent odour was about him. He heard a buzzing rising rapidly in key,
higher&mdash;higher&mdash;yet higher; higher&mdash;higher still; then there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> a
"click." As John Berwick's senses were stolen away by the blessed
influence of an anæsthetic his lips framed the word "Alice." She heard
the name, and was glad.</p>

<p>The first words John uttered as the drug left him were incoherent; but
gradually they took form.</p>

<p>"Who's afraid to die? I'm not afraid to die. What's the good of a man's
religion if he's afraid to die?"</p>

<p>"I know you're not afraid to die," said Alice.</p>

<p>The only reply she got was, "Oh, my head! my head!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your head?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my head! it's bursting."</p>

<p>"Water! water!" continued to be his cry; but Alice would feed him with
only a drop or two at a time. Gradually his ravings grew less
pronounced, less frequent.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, after gazing for some time with dazed eyes at
Alice. "You look very like Alice Peel. Alice is in England, and I
am&mdash;where am I?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad I look like Alice Peel," she said in reply.</p>

<p>"She's the only girl&mdash;in all the world," he murmured, before his mind
again wandered, and he muttered straggling fragments of verses.</p>

<p>"Alice, Alice!" he cried suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice, soothing his head with her cool hand.</p>

<p>He recognized her. "Alice!" he cried again.</p>

<p>She bent over and kissed him. "Go to sleep," she said.</p>

<p>John did as he was commanded. When he woke two hours later he called for
water, and Alice gave him some from a cup.</p>

<p>"Alice, I've been wounded; yes, I remember that&mdash;but how did you get
here?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you to-morrow when you are stronger. You must not excite
yourself now."</p>

<p>But at six o'clock that evening Surgeon-Major Peel, taking his
temperature and finding it normal, gave the necessary permission. So
Alice told their story.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h3>OIL ON TROUBLED WATERS</h3>


<p>John Berwick's accident was the last touch which caused the uprising to
crumble. One more great effort after the ideal of justice had fallen and
parted.</p>

<p>Frank Corte was sitting in front of the Dominion Creek cabin, by the
side of a pool of water that had formed since the claims&mdash;which
rightfully belonged to himself and his three associates&mdash;had been taken
over by the agents of Poo-Bah. The policy of the land was to reap to-day
and spend to-morrow, so a dam had been put in on the "pup" or tributary
of Dominion Creek that entered above the claims; and already a harvest
was in sight. Frank had some possessions in the cabin, which he had come
to fetch before joining the new stampede.</p>

<p>Above the cabin was a line of sluice-boxes, into which half-a-dozen
lusty Scandinavians were shovelling the precious dirt. It was Frank's
own claim they were working&mdash;and he gritted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> teeth. For an instant
his face lost its habitual grin. "If this was only God's country," he
muttered, as he glanced through the open door of the cabin at the rifle
hanging on the wall therein. He continued to whirl the gold-pan which he
held in his hands. In the pan was a handful of dirt he was idly
concentrating. "The boss won't stand for it&mdash;and he's a white man."
Frank smiled again.</p>

<p>From the mining operations at the sluice-boxes, voices came to where
Corte sat. Neither the foreman nor his men had realized that their
voices were carrying beyond the sound of rushing water. They were
shouting that they might hear each other above the roar in the sluices,
and were laughing cheerily&mdash;for Poo-Bah was a good paymaster to his men.
"One dollar, two dollar, one and six bits"&mdash;would float to Frank's ears,
as the foreman estimated the contents of a pan; and he would inwardly
groan as he calculated the wealth that was passing from him into the
great grafter's pocket.</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better clean up; we can get her down to the black sand by
half-past ten and finished an hour later."</p>

<p>Something rose in Frank's throat and almost choked him. The attitude of
these intruders galled him. He half jumped up to seize his rifle, when
"No," he muttered: "Them yellow-legs!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>His attention was attracted to the gold-pan. Specks of gold were
floating upon the water; at the bottom of the pan he noticed an
unmistakable grease spot, and, true to its nature, it had secured to its
surface several of the tiny yellow grains. Grease was alike fatal to the
gold-pan and the stamp battery.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes took on a new light: they were full of energy. He
glanced towards the working miners, and followed the line of sluices to
the artificial pond in the "pup" whence they got their water. "Yes,
yes!" he muttered, and sprang to his feet. He hurried to the quarters of
one of his friends, Jerry, the engineer on a neighbouring claim where a
steam-plant had been installed.</p>

<p>"Jerry," said Frank, "I want two bottles of lubricating oil."</p>

<p>"Pretty near all I got."</p>

<p>"Don't care&mdash;must have it."</p>

<p>"All right, what do you want it for?"</p>

<p>"Frying slap-jacks." Frank went with his evil-smelling petroleum.</p>

<p>"What the devil is he up to!" asked Jerry, as the drooping figure hulked
out of sight. The weasel that peeped at him through the poles of his
cabin floor could not tell him, nor did he know.</p>

<p>Frank put the oil on the table of his cabin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> then went outside and
began chopping wood. It was now the orthodox bed-time, so he must show a
good reason for being about. The sun had just set in the north, the
quarter it sets in the Northland.</p>

<p>"Shut her off," he heard the foreman cry, and he knew the cleaning was
to be commenced. Down came the axe on a four-inch stick of spruce with a
force that burst it asunder and threw the pieces far apart. No
experienced woodman in the ordinary course of events would have used so
much force, and Frank Corte had chopped much wood.</p>

<p>The roar of the water diminished, the voices of the clean-up men fell
away. He could hear no more, but he knew every move. First, the riffles
would be lifted from the sluice-boxes and the dump-box, and the dirt in
the sluice-boxes would be shovelled into the dump-box. Then a strip of
wood, about two inches square, would be placed across the dump-box where
it joined the head of the sluices. This would prevent the gold from
being washed down the boxes.</p>

<p>When these processes were accomplished the foreman shouted "Turn on half
a head," and Ole Oleson, at the gate, allowed half the usual flow of
water to rush down the flume to the dump-box. Had Frank watched the
impact of the water on the dirt in the dump-box he would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> even in the
now failing light, have seen a burst of yellow shine out from what had
previously appeared dross.</p>

<p>As the water reached the dirt the dirt was forced against it by three or
four stout paddles, whereby the husky workmen churned and washed the
dirt thoroughly. Across the dump-box where the water met the pay-dirt
stretched a band of gold. First it was half an inch, and then two
inches. Meanwhile the pebbles and the dross worked their way over the
retaining block and bumped ignominiously to the tailings.</p>

<p>"It looks good," said the foreman in loud tones. Frank heard him then
shout to Ole, "A quarter of a head." Corte, thereupon, threw down his
axe. It was time for action. He went into the cabin, and placed the two
bottles of oil in a bucket, with which he set out for the dam. It was
the most natural thing in the world for a man to draw a bucket of water
before retiring: he might want a drink during the night.</p>

<p>Ole was almost asleep when Frank came up to him. He was lounging over
the gate. Frank greeted him with, "Good-evening, partner; you're working
late to-night."</p>

<p>"Dat's so," was all Ole had life enough to answer. Frank slipped his
bucket into the water; the bottle sank against the mud. The hues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
iridescence spread across the weird and silent surface.</p>

<p>The bottles were safely at the bottom of the pool, and the bucket full
of water, as Frank turned towards the cabin, saying, "Good-night, Ole."
As he neared his cabin he heard the foreman shout, "Shut her half off";
and knew that the work of taking out the black sand from the dust was at
hand. He knew that already the small specks of gold were being carried
to the lower end of the pool. So he made haste, and, taking a blanket,
nailed it at the waste gate of the lower pond, so that the total flood
from above went through it: then he turned in.</p>

<p>He was awake at four on the next morning, and, proceeding to the lower
pond, loosed the blanket, which was heavy with water and gold. Then he
built a fire in the open, and after it was burning well placed the
blanket upon it.</p>

<p>When the blanket was totally consumed and the fire burnt down, Frank
collected the ashes and panned them out. The gold was fine in form and
quality, and proved worth some thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>"Hi-u chickaman stuff," laughed Frank.</p>

<h3>REUNION</h3>


<p>Frank Corte, "mushing" through to Dawson from Dominion Creek, took his
time comfortably and arrived on the second evening. He danced till five
in the morning, after which, as was natural, he lay down and slept.
Accordingly it was not until the evening after his arrival that he gave
a thought to his three companions, and began to search for them by
visiting the Borealis, and going the round of the dance-halls and
gambling-saloons. He found George and Hugh, who were together, but not
John.</p>

<p>Something must surely have happened to him! George Bruce had visited his
den several times lately; he was not there. At last by inquiry at the
police station they learnt that he had hurt himself by falling when
climbing to the Dome, and had been taken to St. George's Private
Hospital.</p>

<p>It was about nine in the evening when the three friends visited him in
the ward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, what's wrong now?" Frank cried; "better than typhoid anyway."</p>

<p>Alice rose in indignation at the noise and clatter; but seeing John
smile, reseated herself. Frank was broadly grinning.</p>

<p>"Alice, this is Frank Corte, my good friend, George Bruce and Hugh
Spencer, my pards; now you know personally the good fellows I've told
you about."</p>

<p>Alice shook hands with them, and there was a moment of some awkwardness,
which Frank broke by saying, "Here," as he laid a large poke of gold on
John's chest.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" asked he.</p>

<p>Frank took a sly glance at Alice&mdash;in fact, he had already taken several.
She was certainly attractive, and had impressed him. His usual
vocabulary was insufficient in the circumstances. He gave a sniff.</p>

<p>"I applicationed the principles of childish lore to the exigencies of
existence in a land of graft and corruption; I lubricated the wheels of
the flow of justice and distracted this here gold-dust from Poo-Bah."</p>

<p>"Who?" inquired Alice, frankly laughing.</p>

<p>"Poo-Bah&mdash;he's the high mucky-muck round here, sort of 'man Friday' to
the Octopus who's got his tentacles round these here environs."</p>

<p>"How did you get the dust?" asked John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> again, as with critical eyes he
estimated the value of the contents of the poke.</p>

<p>"Well, I was sitting in front of our cabin on the claims with my brain
working and my eyes on the 'quivi-vivi,' as them Frenchers would say,
and I was ebolluting hot, and then I thought of grease! So I gets some
lubricating oil, and then Nature does the rest; of course I was the
instrument whereby the oil was placed in the sluices."</p>

<p>John grasped Frank's meaning and method. It flashed upon him at the
mention of the lubricating oil.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do with this gold?" Berwick asked.</p>

<p>"You are going to keep it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I can't do that; why give it to me? Why to me more than to
Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he can get more. He's coming with me to God's country."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Alice, more than ever bewildered.</p>

<p>"To God's country&mdash;the new strike down in Alaska; there'll be no Poo-Bah
there, and plenty of shot-gun justice."</p>

<p>"But there's George's interest."</p>

<p>"George! Oh, he will put his up with ours O.K., I guess." Here Frank
again looked at Alice. "I guess you'll be needing that stuff if parsons
charge like other folks do!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>John smiled at this, and Alice blushed. Leaving the friends together,
for she knew they would wish to talk, she went from the room.</p>

<p>"No, no, Frank, it won't do." Then, seeing that Corte looked troubled,
he added, "I'll take a quarter if you like; you've proved yourself a
comrade. But what's this about the new strike?"</p>

<p>"Big gold excitement&mdash;richer than Bonanza and Eldorado, and, best of
all, in God's country; you'll be coming?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;no, you must remember my work. Are you for giving up our enterprise
to get justice done here and in other goldfields?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, me and Hugh, in fact, everything that don't wear hobbles is
going."</p>

<p>"And leave all this wrong unrighted?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing; this ain't my country. I'm going where things can be made
right overnight, and there ain't no yellow-legs."</p>

<p>"And you, Hugh, are you going to Alaska?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so; you see the chances of getting in on a new strike seem
good&mdash;and&mdash;well, our great show has melted right away. It was a fine
effort, but it failed. I don't mind running chances&mdash;in fact, I'm used
to it; and, after all, that's all Poo-Bah and his chums know, is
grafting. Let them keep their dirty money."</p>

<p>"It's a pity, a pity." John was thoughtful for a time. They were looking
at him. "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> know what I shall do if you and Frank desert me,"
sighed John.</p>

<p>"Get married and settle down," Frank said bluntly.</p>

<p>"You'll do all right," interposed Hugh, "you and George got record for
two claims on the left limit of Bonanza working out your quartz
proposition right against discovery. Well, this is Chechacho Hill, now
reckoned amongst the richest ground in all the Klondike. You and George
don't need to worry about Poo-Bah and Dominion Creek hillsides, nor your
daily bread, no more. I thought I would not tell George the news till I
caught you two together. Frank and I will try our chances again, and
George can stay here and watch you 'live happy ever afterwards.'"</p>

<p>John frowned; his mind reverted to his "Mission." He believed that his
duty was to the great portion of the Klondike's population whom Poo-Bah
and the system of grafters had wronged. He refused even yet to recognize
the game was up.</p>

<p>"Our people&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Our people are mostly down the river striking for God's country, where
there ain't no yellow-legs, and a shot-gun holds down your claim!"</p>

<p>"Frank is right," interposed Hugh, "our whole big following has gone."</p>

<p>John knew this to be only too true. Alas! alas! the fickleness of man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just like the Siwash, Si-Ya Creeks, Hi-u Chickaman, we're all much
alike, yes&mdash;yes, except some"&mdash;and Frank glanced at Alice, who then
entered the room with refreshment for the visitors.</p>

<p>"Frank says that far-away creeks appear to hold much gold," John
translated for the benefit of Alice.</p>

<p>"Well, you're all right with your gold on Chechacho Hill," said Hugh. "I
might have known it was there if I had only thought."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Bruce.</p>

<p>"Because of Carmack finding gold on top of twenty feet of muck. I might
have known that the gold slid down the hill. It wasn't creek gold
Bonanza was discovered on&mdash;no, sir, it was hillside. And that accounts
for its being above the muck there and nowhere else. If a fellow could
only think right before he knows!"</p>

<p>"We'll try and know right down in God's country, Boss. Hugh and I must
be going now. George won't be going with us; he has his claim in this
yellow-leg country."</p>

<p>In the way of the goldfields, they proceeded at once to say good-bye.
Corte and Spencer took their shares of the gold Frank had brought from
Dominion Creek, and went, carrying all manner of wishes for good from
those they were leaving behind.</p>

<h3>RETROSPECTION</h3>


<p>Constable Hope had been attracted by John Berwick, and meant to see more
of him. So that when he met him one day with his arm in a sling he
showed himself friendly.</p>

<p>Smoothbore's trooper was a youth of ideas&mdash;a good type of the fine
force. Though he was still but twenty-four years of age his life had so
often been in danger that he had courage and character far beyond his
years. As the incident which broke down the conspiracy had proved, he
was an adventurer at heart, with more than usual brilliance and spirit.</p>

<p>He would ride into a band of yelling drunken savages and get his man
without showing a gun, and time and again had solved difficulties
through sheer daring, cleverness, and shrewd knowledge of men. He played
the game for love of the game. Money, by way of graft, he did not deem
any reward.</p>

<p>John Berwick had interested him. He felt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> they held interests in
common, so when they met he addressed him. He was not in uniform, and
Berwick had no idea he belonged to the police.</p>

<p>He followed John into one of the gambling-halls, whither John had gone
in search of any of his old-time colleagues who might not have joined
the stampede.</p>

<p>As, standing beside each other, they watched the play at a Black Jack
table, a burly Swede lounged up, and from his hip pocket drew out a bag
of dust, which he laid on the table in line with the wagers of the other
players. The sack held about three thousand dollars-worth of gold.</p>

<p>The dealer dealt each man a card, slipping it under his wager, and then
dealt another round. The different players, starting with the one on the
dealer's left, after looking at what they had drawn, either tapped their
cards if they wished another card or placed their hand beneath their
wager if they were content to "stand."</p>

<p>When it came to the Scandinavian's turn he stood stupidly looking at his
gold.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what do you intend to do?" asked the dealer.</p>

<p>"Have I got to leave that gold there?"</p>

<p>"No, you can take it up if you want to," replied the other.</p>

<p>The Swede hesitated, then picked up his gold and walked away, while the
dealer idly turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> over the cards, at sight of which even the stoic
Dawson audience grew noisy with comments. The cards turned up were an
ace and a king&mdash;Black Jack, a winning hand against all others.</p>

<p>"That's what a fellow gets whose nerve fails him," remarked Constable
Hope.</p>

<p>"Yes, but perhaps it is not always better to win."</p>

<p>Constable Hope glanced shrewdly at John. He followed up the thought with
a searching remark.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it would have been better if the miners had won against the
officials."</p>

<p>"I wonder!" The remark was not encouraging.</p>

<p>"I heard you make your speech at the finish of the Dominion Creek
stampede," Hope persisted in saying; "there does not seem to be much
agitation in these days."</p>

<p>"No, the discontented, or rather the wronged, have gone down the river,
preferring the chances of a new field to securing justice here. Those
who have property are afraid to speak. A goldfield is not a place where
principle flourishes."</p>

<p>"You're not like the Swede; you didn't lose your nerve," said Hope.</p>

<p>Berwick made no reply.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a good man lose his nerve?" the policeman asked.</p>

<p>"No."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I have. Once I was in the mountains down below with a buck
policeman, a Scotch-Canadian from back east, and as good a trooper as
ever sat a horse. Got lost in a blizzard on the prairies later on, and
they never found him till spring&mdash;the coyotes had not left much of him.
Well, Chisholm and I went hunting one day, and, travelling along, came
to a box canyon. We decided to try and cross it; it was a couple of
hundred feet deep, and we started, Chisholm going first. I let him down,
he holding my hands with one of his, while with the other he grabbed a
bush. No sooner had he put his foot on the ledge we figured on getting
down to than he found it soft and yielding. For some reason he dropped
my hand and grabbed at a tuft of moss and hung there. Then his footing
went further down, which drew his chest tight against the wall of the
canyon. I threw myself on my stomach and grabbed him by the collar and
said, 'Jump.' His eyes glistened, and he appeared not to hear me. Then I
looked over the edge and saw that the ledge he had been standing on had
given way entirely, and that he was suspended by his arms alone. He
would not speak; he would not move. The wild light in his eyes faded a
bit, but there he hung, to all appearance dead. Had I not had a lariat
with me I should have been powerless. As it was, I got a slip-knot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
around his feet, and so up under his arms, and this I made fast to a
tree. Then I laughed at him. It is a wonderful light, that which comes
into men's eyes at the fear of death. I have only seen it once again&mdash;in
the eyes of a mother travelling on a river steamer who thought her child
had fallen overboard. Losing your nerve is dangerous."</p>

<p>When their drink and Hope's story were finished they walked out in the
street, where they met Smoothbore. As they passed him John nodded, and
his companion brought his hand half way to the salute and then lowered
it. Hope had given himself away; the other saw he was a policeman.</p>

<p>"You know Smoothbore?" Hope asked.</p>

<p>"I have spoken to him."</p>

<p>Hope did not reply for a moment, after which he continued, "There's a
man who never loses his nerve."</p>

<p>It was the highest tribute Hope could pay.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of Paper-collar Johnnie?"</p>

<p>"No," said John.</p>

<p>"Paper-collar was an officer down below, and he and Smoothbore were
pals. They were out to a banquet one night and returning home late&mdash;in
fact dawn was breaking over the prairie, cold and misty, when they
reached the ford of the river outside their post. It had been raining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
hard, the stream had risen, and the driver drew up before the ford and
said, 'The river seems pretty bad, sir.' 'Hold on,' said Paper-collar,
'this won't do; mustn't try and cross that ford if the river is in
flood.' 'Driver, halt,' ordered Smoothbore, 'my companion wishes to
alight; get down, sir.' Paper-collar stepped down on the prairie. 'Now,
driver, the ford.'"</p>

<p>"And he took it all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and hours afterwards a patrol from the fort picked up poor
Paper-collar."</p>

<p>"What would Smoothbore have done had the miners risen after the Dominion
Creek stampede?" Berwick ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"He'd have fought, and the police would have stood by him. He'd have
used his nerve."</p>

<p>"I learn there is a 'Nordenfelt' and a maxim in the Passes. If the
miners had got them down here and hauled them to the top of the Dome
they would have made things hot in the Barracks."</p>

<p>"Well, maxim or no maxim, Smoothbore would have fought. Neither he nor
any of the police do any grafting; but we should have fought."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is as well the Alaska stampede began," said Berwick
musingly.</p>

<p>"It was very much better," said Hope decisively. So they parted, and
Berwick felt the last word had been said about his bid for miners'
justice.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<h3>THE HAPPY ENDING</h3>


<p>When, the next day, Alice accompanied John and George Bruce in a first
visit to their claims on Chechacho Hill, they saw that the signal thrown
out by the first red tints of the maples and the willows&mdash;which told of
summer ending and the dreary months of winter beginning&mdash;was shown. The
sun was shining brightly, but already it seemed robbed of some of its
heat.</p>

<p>Alice had often pictured life at the diggings. She had read numbers of
mining-camp stories, with scenes laid in America and Australia, yet had
gained little insight to the realities. She gloried in the experience,
and was eager to urge them on. "Hurry! hurry!" but John exhorted her to
stay her speed, for the distance they had to go was twenty-four miles,
and the trail&mdash;though many of the mud-holes had dried&mdash;was rough.</p>

<p>She looked at the men she met, hunting for the type of her fancy, the
type engendered by novel and tale. No one seemed armed, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
occasionally with a rifle or a shot-gun; but the wild man with the brace
of pistols, bandolier, huge moustache and homicidal aspect did not
present himself!</p>

<p>They crossed the Klondike by Poo-Bah's ferry. Once in Bonanza Valley
Alice felt she had left the civilized world behind her, and was entering
the enchanted regions of Nature. To her, in her happy illusions, it was
fairy-land.</p>

<p>Few women had preceded her over the Bonanza trail, so that men,
"mushing," who passed their fellows with lowered head, openly stared at
her; and many of these lonely wayfarers would have been glad of a word
from her, to hear again the sweet soft accents of the better world
outside. For to the men of the frontier the idea of home is very refined
and dear, and women ever virtuous and tender, so that the appearance of
Alice Peel, on the Bonanza trail upon that glorious day, was to them as
a beautiful picture and an uplifting influence.</p>

<p>One grizzled miner hurried out, holding a gold-pan full of nuggets,
dust, and black sand.</p>

<p>"Put your hand into it, lady, and see what it feels like."</p>

<p>Alice did so, and thought it felt like any other sand, only heavier. He
then selected a nugget&mdash;worth quite a sovereign&mdash;from the pan and gave
it to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you give me this?"</p>

<p>"Because you are a lady."</p>

<p>Alice looked perplexed.</p>

<p>"Keep it as a souvenir," said John, so she thanked the man and slipped
the nugget inside her glove. But that was not to be the limit of their
host's hospitality, for, as they turned to go, he said,</p>

<p>"It's just about noon, and if you've walked from Dawson the lady must be
near petered. Better stay and have dinner."</p>

<p>"We thought of dining at the road-house at Discovery," said George. "We
have some ground on Chechacho Hill."</p>

<p>"I can give you a better feed here: moose-meat, either steak or nose,
whichever you fancy. You see, lady, in the old days this was a sort of a
pet locality for moose, so they stray in once in a while yet, and
sometimes they don't get a chance to get away again."</p>

<p>The sound of a horn came from a tent close by.</p>

<p>The signal was answered by a general throwing down of tools, and the
half-dozen men at work made their way towards the tent. They all washed
in a couple of tin basins, and dried themselves on a filthy towel.</p>

<p>Alice and her companions were ushered into the dining-tent, where,
John's quick eyes noticed, extra places had been set. Alice was asked to
sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> at the head of the table, in the owner's place: John and George
were seated at her right, and the owner&mdash;Wild Horse Bill&mdash;on the left.
The men were already hard at work, consuming their food&mdash;moose-steak,
pork and beans, and great pieces of bread.</p>

<p>As they sat down the cook placed on the table a large tin platter, in
which was a piece of meat of indescribable colour and shape.</p>

<p>"This is moose nose, lady, the best part of the animal, and along with
the beaver tail and wild-cat makes the finest eating in the Northland."</p>

<p>"Wild-cat!" Alice exclaimed. She had indeed read of the tail of Canada's
mascot being a frontier dainty, but moose nose, and especially wild-cat,
were new, and did not sound altogether attractive articles of diet.</p>

<p>"Yes, lady, the lynx, or wild-cat, is the best eating the trapper knows
in the Northland. You would think you were eating chicken. As for moose
nose and beaver tail, one is much like the other."</p>

<p>The owner pushed the platter containing the strange dainty towards
Alice, with the words, "Help yourself, lady."</p>

<p>Alice was game; and, without showing her disinclination, she took up the
knife and fork and cut off a piece of the blubberous meat, and put it on
her plate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>After they had walked about a mile and a half beyond the claim where
they had lunched they stood beneath Chechacho Hill at the north-east, a
quarter of a mile down-stream from where Carmack had made his discovery;
and John pointed to where their claims were situate. Men were at work,
"rocking" gold on the next claim to John's.</p>

<p>When they reached their claims Alice looked across the valley, noting
the great stretches of poplar and birch, golden-yellow in their autumn
tints, and smiled at the beauty of it&mdash;till out of the chilled
atmosphere somewhere came the whisper, "Make haste and provide."</p>

<p>"I should like to live here always," whispered Alice to John, while
Bruce went to talk with the men working on the claim alongside.</p>

<p>"Always is a long time, and every day will not be as beautiful as this;
but for a year or two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a year or two."</p>

<p>And so it was decided.</p>

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
